On December 22, 2020, Humana was informed that an employee of a Humana subcontractor
inappropriately used their access to your information to disclose information, in the form of medical
records, to unauthorized individuals in an effort to train medical coders for a personal coding business
endeavor. The subcontractor discovered the incident on December 16, 2020. The activity occurred October
12, 2020 through December 16, 2020. We deeply apologize for this situation.
Cotiviti is a vendor Humana uses for quality reporting and risk adjustment purposes. Risk adjustment is
required of Medicare Advantage plans, like Humana, by the federal Medicare agency, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Cotiviti provides systems that allow Humana to contact health care
providers and request medical records for this process.
Cotiviti utilizes a subcontractor, Visionary. A Visionary employee was attempting to train unauthorized
individuals on how to conduct Medicare Risk Adjustment coding as part of a personal business endeavor.
The Visionary employee, who was authorized to access and use the data for Humana purposes, disclosed
the information to the unauthorized individuals through a personal Google Drive account.
Humana requires executed Business Associate Agreements with all organizations that perform any services
on our behalf involving our members’ protected health information. This Business Associate Agreement
requires Cotiviti to comply with federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
regulations and to follow guidelines and policies established by Humana in maintaining the privacy and
confidentiality of all protected health information. We also conduct assessments of our business associates
to verify that processes are being followed. Similarly, Cotiviti has executed Business Associate Agreements
with their subcontractors that holds them to these same standards.

Kroger said an unauthorized person gained access to Accellion, a software company used by Kroger, to securely transfer files. 

The unknown person accessed Kroger files by exploiting a vulnerability in the transfer service, according to the news release.

Kroger stopped using Accellion's services after being informed of the incident.

The grocery company started its own forensic investigation into the potential scope and impact of the data breach.

Kroger said the incident affected beneficiaries under its Health and Welfare Benefit Plan and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefit Plan.

Potentially affected customers are in the process of being contacted by Kroger.

access to folders on Cintas's file servers. The investigation was not able to determine which files

careful review of the folders to see what kinds of information they contained. Cintas completed

WestRock – the second-largest packaging company in the U.S. – continues to restore its systems, two weeks after it discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack.

WestRock, which has more than 320 manufacturing facilities globally, creates packaging supplies for a bevy of high-profile clients, including General Motors, Heinz and Home Depot.

The ransomware attack was discovered on Jan. 23 and affected the company’s operational technology (OT) systems. These systems are comprised of equipment used to manage, monitor and control industrial operations. That means that several of WestRock’s factory processes – including mill system production and packaging-converting operations – were crippled.



“WestRock is undertaking extensive efforts to identify, contain and recover from this incident quickly and securely,” said the company, in a new update on the attack, Friday. “Upon discovering the incident, WestRock immediately began an investigation, implemented business-continuity processes and initiated response containment protocols with the support of cybersecurity experts.”

Ransomware Attack: Impact on WestRock
In a presentation on its first-quarter earnings results for 2021 for its investors, WestRock said that there is currently no evidence that customer or coworker data has been compromised by attackers.

As a result of the ransomware attack, shipments for some of the company’s facilities have lagged in production levels, according to the company. For instance, the firm’s mill system production, through Feb. 4, was approximately 85,000 tons lower than planned, it said.

For context, according to its 2020 annual report, WestRock’s annual production capacity for corrugated packaging mills (to create cardboard utilized by various commercial companies) in 2020 was almost 12 million, while its annual production capacity for consumer packaging mills was almost 4 million.

Dirk Schrader, global vice president at New Net Technologies (NNT), said that while WestRock was quick in reporting the incident, this lag points to struggles around the company’s initial “response and containment protocols.”

“Being affected by a cyberattack at production control and plant level is not only going to cost you revenue from that loss in production, it affects the reputation and the supply chain of your up-stream customers,” Schrader said.

The attack also hits a company that has shifted to high gear to keep up with the increased demand for online shopping — and consequently, more packaging — triggered by COVID-19. WestRock said it has been working to support critical infrastructure, supply chains and other manufacturers in delivering their goods to consumers during the ongoing pandemic.

WestRock Takes Ransomware Remediation Steps 
Despite the lag in production, WestRock said this “gap is closing quickly as systems are restored.” Its packaging converting operations are also close to returning to full planned production levels.

“The WestRock team remains in regular communication with its customers to share information and updates and to meet their business needs,” said WestRock on Friday. “WestRock is also working with its vendors so they are informed, and supply chains remain operational.”

What’s still unknown is what kind of ransomware was used in the attack, whether a ransom was paid and how the attack was launched. Threatpost has reached out to WestRock for further comment.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.72000122070313,53.18000030517578,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For three decades, the Greeneville, Tennessee-based company has been providing ground transportation and related logistics services to the air freight and expedited less than load (LTL) market in North America.

In a December 2020 filing with SEC, the company revealed that a ransomware incident affected its operational and information technology systems, causing service delays.

The company was able to quickly contain the incident, after which it launched an investigation into it and also informed the appropriate authorities.

Recovery operations lasted for at least a couple of weeks, and the company said at the time that the incident was expected to cause loss of revenue, due to continuous delays in the company’s business.

In an 8-K form filed with SEC this week, the transportation giant revealed that the ransomware attack indeed had a financial impact.

“While the Company’s systems recovery efforts are completed and the Company’s operations are fully functional, the incident did result in a loss of revenue as well as incremental costs for the month of December which will adversely impact the Company’s fourth quarter 2020 results,” Forward Air said.

Overall, the incident is expected to result in the loss of an estimated $7.5 million of LTL revenue, mainly because it had to suspend “electronic data interfaces with its customers,” the transportation company says.

While Forward Air did not provide information on the ransomware family responsible for the attack, FreightWaves reported that the Hades ransomware gang was behind the incident.

SecurityWeek has contacted Forward Air for additional details on the incident and the attackers’ demands and will update the article if a response arrives.",https://ir.forwardaircorp.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000912728-21-000005/0000912728-21-000005.pdf,2021-02-03 00:00:00,,,,,7500000,,,,,,,73.38999938964844,88.73999786376953,89.4000015258789,,,,,,,,,,,,

The software automation engineer, Alex Khatilov, was hired as one of a few employees to have access to the files, which the company says were unrelated to his job.

Khatilov stated that after being hired in December, Tesla sent files to his personal dropbox, which contained sensitive information that could be accessed from his personal computer. While investigators have located thousands of confidential files in Khatilov’s storage, which he attempted to destroy before starting the interview, the company found no other evidence of whether he previously shared the data with other associates or locations. The electric-car maker claimed that the scripts are extremely valuable to Tesla, and giving unauthorized access to these scripts would enable engineers at other companies to reverse engineer Tesla’s processes to create a similar system in a fraction of the time.  Occurrences like this can not only leave enterprises at a heavily competitive disadvantage, but lead to a loss of trust externally but customers and other stakeholders.

The security incident happened around Sept. 29, 2020. At that time, Wind River found that one or more files, which contained personally identifiable information, had been downloaded by an unknown third party, according to the breach notification filed in California.

In the report, Wind River did not provide information on the number of people affected and whether the incident involved employees, customers or both. The company did say that the exposed data includes Social Security numbers, passport and visa details, dates of birth and driver's license numbers, as well as health information and financial account information.

Wind River notes that it is working with law enforcement officials and third-party security experts to investigate the incident. ""However, we have no indication that any information in the affected files has been misused. Recent searches by our experts did not uncover any of these files online,"" the notification states.

Alameda, California-based Wind River is known for developing code for intelligent connected systems, embedded software, development tools and simulation technology. It also produces industry-specific products for the aerospace and defense industries as well as organizations in the industrial and automotive fields.

A spokesperson for Wind River could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday.

Wind River has yet to provide details on how the attackers were able to compromise the files in its network. The company, however, notes that it has installed additional security monitoring tools and implemented new processes and says it will focus on improving the cyber resiliency of its network.

On June 28, 2020, USAP became aware of suspicious activity on its computer network. USAP immediately
launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists, and determined
that its network had been infected with malware which prevented access to certain files on the system. The
investigation determined that the malware was introduced into the system by an unauthorized actor who
also accessed and acquired certain files in USAP’s system. The unauthorized access occurred between June
21, 2020 and June 28, 2020. USAP then began a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify sensitive
information that may have been contained within accessible files, and to identify the individuals whose
information may have been impacted. USAP then worked to identify contact information for the impacted
individuals. That process completed on January 8, 2021. USAP is notifying those individuals whose
personal information may have been impacted.
The impacted information varied by Maine resident but included name, address, Social Security number,
and driver’s license number.
Notice to Maine Residents
On or about February 1, 2021, USAP is providing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals,
which includes approximately three (3) Maine residents. A sample of the letter is attached hereto and

EMA confirmed the threat actors behind the attack had posted the stolen data online last week. Several days later, the investigation revealed the data had been altered prior to the leak.

The reports around the hacking incident came to light in early December, which found hackers accessed and exfiltrated data related to the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech. EMA is tasked with vaccine assessments and approvals for the EU.

The highly targeted attack struck on December 9, which gave the attackers access to some documents tied to the regulatory submission for the impacted pharmaceutical companies that were stored on the compromised server.

Pfizer and BioNTech were awaiting final approval for their vaccine, which was issued temporary authorization for emergency use in the UK on December 2. The previous update confirmed the attack was confined to just one IT application and the documents stored on the server.

The regulator has been working with the UK National Cyber Security Centre and law enforcement on the investigation, while it works to secure the data.

The latest update revealed the stolen and altered data included internal, confidential email correspondence from November that were tied to the evaluation processes for COVID-19 vaccines.

“Some of the correspondence has been manipulated by the perpetrators prior to publication in a way which could undermine trust in vaccines,” EMA officials explained. “Two EU marketing authorisations for COVID-19 vaccines have been granted at the end of December/beginning of January following an independent scientific assessment.”

“EMA is in constant dialogue with the European Commission and other regulators across the network and internationally,” they added. “[EMA] continues to fully support the criminal investigation into the data breach. Necessary action is being taken by the law enforcement authorities.”

Federal agencies have repeatedly warned that hackers are actively, and successfully, targeting healthcare organizations tasked with the COVID-19 response for these exact purposes. Nation-state actors have also targeted healthcare employees in an effort to gain access to valuable COVID-19 data.

Recently, Cold storage giant Americold and Global firm Miltenyi Biotec were targeted with cyberattacks in an apparent attempt to disrupt the vaccine supply chain. And as the vaccine rollout progresses, attacks on healthcare web apps rose 51 percent.
Hackers Post Stolen Data from 2 Healthcare Entities

Threat actors have once again posted data they claim to have stolen from healthcare entities. Last week, the Conti hacking group posted data allegedly exfiltrated from Medtron, and Netwalker actors leaked data they claim to have stolen from Granite Wellness Centers.

Louisiana-based Medtron Software Intelligence provides integrated practice management and EHR tech to medical practices. Granite Wellness Centers, previously known as Community Recovery Resources, creates individualized wellness prevention programs, including family services and housing support.

For Granite Wellness, screenshots shared with HealthITSecurity.com show the hackers appear to have stolen a range of spreadsheets containing business information, as well case management and consultation information.

As previously noted, data exfiltration has grown increasingly common in the last year. Emsisoft data shows there are at least 17 ransomware threat actors leveraging extortion to increase payout from victims.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.72999954223633,34.560001373291016,35.77000045776367,,,,,,,,,,,,

UPS (NYSE: UPS) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) said they are looking into whether employee health data was compromised after hackers posted medical records of truck drivers and rail workers to a leak site following an apparent ransomware attack and data breach at a Virginia-based occupational health-care provider. 

It was not immediately clear how many UPS and Norfolk Southern personnel were affected by the leak of over 3,000 files from occupational health provider Taylor Made Diagnostics on Jan. 8. But FreightWaves found multiple health records for employees from both firms, in addition to multiple smaller trucking companies, U.S. government agencies and defense contractors from as recently as December 2020.

The railway, which employs nearly 25,000 people and operates in 22 states, would not say if it had been informed about the data breach.

UPS also told FreightWaves it was looking into the breach, but would not discuss how many of its drivers may have been affected.

On September 18, 2020, we became aware of some unusual activity involving one of the third-party vendors that
operates our website. We took immediate action to secure the system and investigate the situation, including engaging
forensic investigators to assess what occurred. During the investigation we discovered that an unauthorized third
party accessed some of our cloud storage on September 17, 2020.
What Information Was Involved?
We completed a review of the contents of the impacted cloud storage, however the investigation was unable to
determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any specific data in the system. In an abundance of caution,
we are notifying anyone whose personal information was stored in the accessed cloud storage, which may include
your <<variable data elements>>.
What We Are Doing.
Upon discovering the unauthorized user, we made changes to our system to prevent that unauthorized party from
further accessing our systems. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we are taking steps
to enhance our existing security program, implementing multiple layers of protective measures, ensuring that we
follow best practices in the security of our data storage, and re-educating our staff in proper handling of secure data.
What You Can Do.
While we have no indication that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized party, or that it has been
misused, we wanted to notify you of this incident and remind you that it is always advisable to remain vigilant for
signs of unauthorized activity by reviewing your financial account statements. If you see charges or activity you did
not authorize, we suggest that you contact the provider immediately. In an abundance of caution, we are offering you
a complimentary membership in Experian’s® IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with identity detection and
resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your

They did not specify the cloud provider that hosts its databases, nor how the attackers managed to gain access to them.
The scope of the Ubiquiti data breach

“We cannot be certain that user data has not been exposed. This data may include your name, email address, and the one-way encrypted password to your account (in technical terms, the passwords are hashed and salted). The data may also include your address and phone number if you have provided that to us,” the company explained in an online alert and and notification sent directly to users.

Ubiquiti made sure to point out that they “have no indication that there has been unauthorized activity with respect to any user’s account,” but nevertheless encouraged every users to change the password and enable two-factor authentication on their Ubiquiti accounts, and to change their password on any website where they use the same user ID or password.

It’s still unknown whether the possible Ubiquiti data breach is related with the outage to the UniFi cloud management platform experienced on Sunday (as documented on the company’s System Status page):

The page also documented a surge of users resetting their passwords that caused a delay in password reset emails being delivered.
How to change the password and enable 2FA?

Despite many customers being unhappy with the fact that they are required to create an account through the company’s cloud service to activate Ubiquiti devices, their popularity is unquestionable: Ubiquiti claims that nearly 85 million of its devices “play a key role in creating networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories around the world.”

The email alerts sent by the company contain direct links to the web portal (located at account.ui.com), but some users were understandably worried that the email may be a phishing attempt.

Though the legitimacy of the emails has been confirmed by Ubiquiti, it’s a good practice to avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails.

To change their passwords, customers should visit the web portal indipendently, log in, go to Settings and select the Security tab. There, they can change their password, set a session timeout value, and enable 2FA.

Customers who have forgotten their password or aren’t sure whether they’ve set up an account in the first place can use the “Forgot password?” option, enter their email address and wait for the password reset email.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,257.45001220703125,356.55999755859375,336.2300109863281,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Mimecast-issued certificate used to authenticate some of the company’s products to Microsoft 365 Exchange Web Services has been “compromised by a sophisticated threat actor,” the company has announced.

Mimecast provides email security services that customers can apply to their Microsoft 365 accounts by establishing a connection to Mimecast’s servers. The certificate in question is used to verify and authenticate those connections made to Mimecast’s Sync and Recover (backups for mailbox folder structure, calendar content and contacts from Exchange On-Premises or Microsoft 365 mailboxes), Continuity Monitor (looks for disruptions in email traffic) and Internal Email Protect (IEP) (inspects internally generated emails for malicious links, attachments or for sensitive content).

A compromise means that cyberattackers could take over the connection, though which inbound and outbound mail flows, researchers said. It would be possible to intercept that traffic, or possibly to infiltrate customers’ Microsoft 365 Exchange Web Services and steal information.

“The certificates that were compromised were used by Mimecast email security products,” Terence Jackson, CISO at Thycotic, told Threatpost. “These products would access customers Microsoft 365 exchange servers in order for them to provide security services (backup, spam and phishing protection). Since these certificates were legit, an adversary would have been able to connect without raising suspicions to eavesdrop and exfiltrate email communications.”

There would be additional steps necessary for the attacker to compromise sensitive information, according to Chris Clements, vice president of Solutions Architecture at Cerberus Sentinel.

“They don’t appear to have identified the exact nature and use case for the certificate compromised but two possibilities are likely,” he told Threatpost. “First, if the stolen certificate was used for Mimecast customers to verify the validity of the servers their users’ connect to (user -> Mimecast), it would allow an attacker that was able to man-in-the middle the user to server connection to easily decrypt the encrypted data stream and access potentially sensitive information.”

This would require the attackers to have compromised a device in the data path between the Mimecast customer’s users and servers; be present on the same local network to perform an ARP spoofing attack; or simply be connected to the same open Wi-Fi network.

“The other much worse possibility is that the stolen certificate was used to authenticate from Mimecast servers directly to Microsoft 365 (Mimecast -> MS365),” he said. “If this were the case and no other security controls limiting access were in place, attackers with this certificate could potentially use it to connect directly to Microsoft and access all of the customer’s data.”

Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, told Threatpost that attackers could also possibly disable Office 365’s Mimecast protections altogether to make an email-borne attack more effective.

“This would allow access to mail hosted on Office 365, possibly disable certain services like threat protection and alerts, and possibly more,” he said. “This is a compromise of a machine identity: the certificate is the identity of Mimecast services authenticating to Microsoft cloud.”
Mimecast Remains Mum

When reached for comment, a Mimecast spokesperson only said, “Our investigation is ongoing and we don’t have anything additional to share at this time. All updates from Mimecast will be delivered through our blog.”

Mimecast, in a short online posting on Tuesday, said that about 10 percent of its customers use the affected connections. It notes on its website that it has around 36,000 customers, so 3,600 could be potentially compromised. The company went on to say that out of those, “there are indications that a low single digit number of our customers’ Microsoft 365 tenants were targeted. We have already contacted these customers to remediate the issue.”

The hack was brought to Mimecast’s attention by Microsoft, which plans to disable the certificate’s use for Microsoft 365 starting on Jan. 18. In the meantime, Mimecast has issued a new certificate and is urging users to re-establish their connections with the fresh authentication.

The attack is reminiscent of the recently discovered SolarWinds hacks, because of the use of third-party software to reach targets. And indeed, researchers speaking anonymously to Reuters about the Mimecast incident told the outlet that they suspected the same advanced persistent threat responsible for the SolarWinds supply-chain attack is at work here.

Mimecast declined to comment on that assessment.

“The attack against Mimecast and their secure connection to Microsoft’s Office 365 infrastructure appears to be the work of the same sophisticated attackers that breached SolarWinds and multiple government agencies,” Saryu Nayyar, CEO at Gurucul, said via email. “This shows the skill and tenacity state and state-sponsored actors can bring to bear when they are pursuing their agenda. Against this sort of opponent, civilian organizations will need to up their game if they don’t want to become the next headline. Basic cybersecurity is not enough. Organizations need to employ industry best practices, and then go farther with user education, programs to review and update their security, and deploying best in breed security solutions…The long-term advantage is that defenses designed to resist a state-level attack should be more than enough to thwart the more common cybercriminal.”", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.4000015258789,42.88999938964844,42.59000015258789,,,,,,,,,,,,

information. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we take this incident very
seriously and we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and resources available to
you to help protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.
What Happened? Earlier this year, Veritex became aware of unusual activity involving certain employee email accounts
and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators. On May 8, 2020, the
investigation determined that certain employee email accounts were accessed without authorization at varying times
between April 2, 2020 and April 27, 2020. Unfortunately, the available evidence did not allow us to determine what, if
any, emails and attachments were viewed while the accounts were subject to unauthorized access.
Therefore, the forensic investigator reviewed the email accounts to identify any personal information that was located in
the email accounts at the time of the unauthorized access and could have been accessible. On September 25, 2020, we
determined that some personal information was present in one or more of the email accounts at the time of the incident.
We reviewed this information and our internal records to identify the individuals associated with this information
and their address for purposes of providing notice. Through this process we determined that some of your personal
information was contained in one or more of the impacted email accounts.
What Information Was Involved? Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the email accounts
contained information including your name, <<Data Elements>>. To date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted
misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.
What We Are Doing. We take this incident and the security of personal information in our care very seriously. Upon
learning of this incident, we promptly began an investigation using external digital forensic specialists, changed
email account credentials, and investigated to confirm the security of our email network. We are also working to

The Edmonton-based cannabis producer says the incident took place on Dec. 25, but did not share what data was involved or how it was accessed.

Spokeswoman Michelle Lefler says in an email to The Canadian Press that as soon as Aurora learned of the incident, it took immediate steps to mitigate it.

She says Aurora is following all security protocols and consulting with security experts.

Lefler says Aurora’s patient systems were not compromised and the company’s network of operations is unaffected.

Statistics Canada says one-fifth of Canadian businesses were affected by cybersecurity incidents in 2019, the most recently available data.

Almost half of those attacks were linked to large businesses, 29 per cent at medium-sized companies and 18 per cent at small businesses.

Starting yesterday, T-Mobile began texting customers that a ""security incident"" exposed their account's information.

According to T-Mobile, its security team recently discovered ""malicious, unauthorized access"" to their systems. After bringing in a cybersecurity firm to perform an investigation, T-Mobile found that threat actors gained access to the telecommunications information generated by customers, known as CPNI.

The information exposed in this breach includes phone numbers, call records, and the number of lines on an account.

""Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) as defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules was accessed.

T-Mobile states that the data breach did not expose account holders' names, physical addresses, email addresses, financial data, credit card information, social security numbers, tax IDs, passwords, or PINs.

In a statement to BleepingComputer, T-Mobile stated that this breach affected a ""small number of customers (less than 0.2%).""  T-Mobile has approximately 100 million customers, which equates to around 200,000 people affected by this breach.

""We are currently notifying a small number of customers (less than 0.2%) that some information related to their account may have been illegally accessed.

The Journal identified infected computers at two dozen organizations that installed tainted network monitoring software called SolarWinds Orion that allowed the hackers in via a covertly inserted backdoor. It gave them potential access to much sensitive corporate and personal data.

Among them: technology giant Cisco Systems Inc., chip makers Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. , accounting firm Deloitte LLP, cloud-computing software maker VMware Inc. and Belkin International Inc., which sells home and office Wi-Fi routers and networking gear under the LinkSys and Belkin brands. The attackers also had access to the California Department of State Hospitals and Kent State University.

The victims offer a small window into the sweeping scope of the hack, which could have ensnared as many as 18,000 of Austin-based SolarWinds Corp.’s customers, the company said, after hackers laced a routine software update with malicious code.

SolarWinds said that it traced activity from the hackers back to at least October 2019 and that it is now working with security companies, law enforcement and intelligence agencies to investigate the attack.

Cisco confirmed that it found the malicious software on some employee systems and a small number of laboratory systems. The company is still investigating. “At this time, there is no known impact to Cisco offers or products,” a company spokesman said.

Intel downloaded and ran the malicious software, the Journal’s analysis found. The company is investigating the incident and has found no evidence the hackers used the backdoor to access the company’s network, a spokesman said.

Deloitte, infected in late June according to the Journal’s analysis, said it “has taken steps to address” the malware but hasn’t “observed indications of unauthorized access to our systems at this time.”

VMware said it found “limited instances” of the malicious software in its systems, but its “internal investigation has not revealed any indication of exploitation,” a spokesman said.

Belkin said in an email that it removed the backdoor immediately after federal officials issued an alert last week. “There has been no known negative impact identified to date,” a company spokeswoman said.

A Kent State University spokeswoman said the school “was aware of the situation and are evaluating this serious matter.”

The California Department of State Hospitals installed the backdoor by early August, according to the Journal’s analysis. State officials are working with federal and state agencies to address the impact of the SolarWinds backdoor, according to a spokesman for California’s Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, who declined to comment on specific agencies affected.

An Nvidia spokesman said the company has “no evidence at this time that Nvidia was adversely affected and our investigation is ongoing.”

The Journal gathered digital clues from victim computers collected by threat-intelligence companies Farsight Security and RiskIQ and then used decryption methods to reveal the identities of some of the servers that downloaded the malicious code. In some cases, the analysis led to the identity of compromised organizations and showed when the code was likely activated—indicating that the hackers had access.

It isn’t yet known what the hackers did inside the various organizations, or if they even used the backdoors for many of the companies. But investigators and security experts say that besides internal communications and other government secrets, hackers may have sought emails of corporate executives, files about sensitive technologies under development, and other ways to compromise more systems later.

The uncertainty has left SolarWinds’ customers—which include major technology companies, more than 400 Fortune 500 companies and many government agencies—scrambling to determine the fallout and whether the hackers remain inside.

The attack blended extraordinarily stealthy tradecraft, using cyber tools never before seen in a previous attack, with a strategy that zeroed in on a weak link in the software supply chain that all U.S. businesses and government institutions rely on—an approach security experts have long feared but one that has never been used on U.S. targets in such a concerted way.

Government agencies and cybersecurity experts are still working to piece together the massive suspected espionage operation. At least six federal agencies, including the departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy, were hacked as part of the campaign.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency last week published an alert that said the hack was “grave” and ongoing. SolarWinds has released an update that closes the backdoor, and Microsoft Corp. has taken control of part of the hackers’ infrastructure to prevent the attack from spreading.

Federal investigators have concluded that the Russian government is likely responsible for the hack in part because of the level of skill involved. Several senators who have received briefings in recent days have openly referred to it as a Russian operation. And on Friday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo became the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Moscow, although President Trump in a tweet Saturday suggested without evidence that China could be responsible.

Moscow has denied responsibility.

“Customers are definitely freaking out,” said David Kennedy, whose company, TrustedSec LLC, is investigating the hack. For many companies the concern is whether the attackers stole data or remain undetected within corporate networks, he said. What’s more, because the attack dates back many months, some companies may no longer have the forensic data needed to do a complete investigation.

“If this is indeed SVR, as we believe it is, those guys are incredibly hard to kick out of networks,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert and co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank, referring to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.

Some organizations that maintain better records of activity on their systems will likely be able to determine whether somebody walked through the Russian backdoor onto their networks, said Mr. Alperovitch, the former chief technology officer and co-founder of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. But for others, especially smaller or midsize companies, it will be a difficult and expensive task that many are likely to ignore—meaning Russia could maintain a presence in some networks indefinitely.

“They probably are just going to remove the backdoor and move on,” Mr. Alperovitch said.

For many corporate victims, the looming fear now is that the hackers could use them as an avenue to get to their clients. For example, Microsoft found in research released Thursday that nearly half its more than 40 customers hit in the attack were information technology service companies, which often have broad access to their customers’ networks.

Microsoft, itself a SolarWinds customer, said last week it had also detected malicious software related to the hack on its own network but “no indications that our systems were used to attack others,” a company spokeswoman said.

The news comes after the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) published an alert earlier today about the SolarWinds supply chain attack and its impact on government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations.

Also: Best VPNs

CISA said they had ""evidence of additional initial access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform.""

Two Reuters reports on the alleged Microsoft hack did not say what Microsoft products the hackers abused after breaching Microsoft.

In a statement, Microsoft admitted to finding trojanized SolarWinds Orion apps in its environment, but not to hackers pivoting to production systems and then using those systems against its customers. The full, unedited statement is available below:

    ""Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious Solar Winds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed. We have not found evidence of access to production services or customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications that our systems were used to attack others."" 

Five new SolarWinds hack victims came to light today

Microsoft now joins a list of high-profile entities that have been hacked via a backdoored update for the SolarWinds Orion network monitoring application.

The vast majority of these victims are US government agencies, such as:

    The US Treasury Department
    The US Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
    The Department of Health's National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)

    The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) (also disclosed today)
    The US Department of Energy (DOE) (also disclosed today)
    Three US states (also disclosed today)
    City of Austin (also disclosed today) 

The only private company which acknowledged getting hacked via the malware-laced SolarWinds platform is cybersecurity firm FireEye.

Both FireEye and Microsoft were the first security firms to confirm the SolarWinds hack on Sunday, both providing extensive reports of how the breach happened.

Both companies were also involved in an effort to sinkhole the domain used to command and control the malware used in the SolarWinds hack. ", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,219.27999877929688,212.6499938964844,243.6999969482422,237.7100067138672,,,,,,,,,,,

may have impacted your personal information. MEDNAX provides revenue cycle management and other administrative
services to its affiliated physician practice groups, including <<b2b_text_1 (covered entity name,/one)>> from which you
may have received services.
What happened?
On June 19, 2020, MEDNAX discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain Microsoft Office
365-hosted MEDNAX business email accounts through phishing. “Phishing” occurs when an email is sent that looks like
it is from a trustworthy source, but it is not. The phishing email prompts the recipient to share or give access to certain
information. Upon discovery of this event, MEDNAX immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized
activity, began an investigation, and engaged a national forensic firm.
Based on the investigation, the unauthorized party was able to access certain business email accounts between June 17,
2020 and June 22, 2020. The event was limited to a small number of business email accounts. Those email accounts are
separate from MEDNAX’s internal network and systems, which were not involved in the event. Even though a thorough
investigation was conducted, it was not possible to conclusively determine whether personal information was actually
accessed by the unauthorized party. Based on the data analysis that was performed and ultimately completed in late
November 2020, we were able to determine which individuals may have had personal information in the impacted business
email accounts.<<b2b_text_2 (“ The data of forty-five (45) Rhode Island residents may have been impacted.”)>> Based
upon our thorough review of this matter, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a
result of this event. However, we are notifying you because your personal information may have been in one or more of
the impacted business email accounts.
What information may have been involved?
The patient information may have included: (1) patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address,
email address, and date of birth); (2) Social Security number, driver’s license number, state identification number, and/
or financial account information; (3) health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information
including type and deductible amount and subscriber/Medicare/Medicaid number); (4) medical and/or treatment information
(dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, prescription information, physician names,
and Medical Record Numbers); and (5) billing and claims information (invoices, submitted claims and appeals, and patient
account identifiers used by your provider). Please note that not all data fields may have been involved for all individuals.
What we are doing.
MEDNAX takes the security of personal information seriously. As soon as we discovered the phishing event, we
immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, including resetting user passwords for business email accounts where unauthorized activity was detected. We have and continue to enhance our security controls as
appropriate to minimize the risk of any similar event in the future.

SolarWinds Corporation (“SolarWinds” or the “Company”) has been made aware of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability within its Orion monitoring products which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run. SolarWinds has been advised that this incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state, but SolarWinds has not independently verified the identity of the attacker. SolarWinds has retained third-party cybersecurity experts to assist in an investigation of these matters, including whether a vulnerability in the Orion monitoring products was exploited as a point of any infiltration of any customer systems, and in the development of appropriate mitigation and remediation plans. SolarWinds is cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. intelligence community, and other government agencies in investigations related to this incident.

Based on its investigation to date, SolarWinds has evidence that the vulnerability was inserted within the Orion products and existed in updates released between March and June 2020 (the “Relevant Period”), was introduced as a result of a compromise of the Orion software build system and was not present in the source code repository of the Orion products. SolarWinds has taken steps to remediate the compromise of the Orion software build system and is investigating what additional steps, if any, should be taken. SolarWinds is not currently aware that this vulnerability exists in any of its other products.

SolarWinds currently believes that:

•Orion products downloaded, implemented or updated during the Relevant Period contained the vulnerability;

•Orion products downloaded and implemented before the Relevant Period and not updated during the Relevant Period did not contain the vulnerability;

•Orion products downloaded and implemented after the Relevant Period did not contain the vulnerability; and

•Previously affected versions of the Orion products that were updated with a build released after the Relevant Period no longer contained the vulnerability; however, the server on which the affected Orion products ran may have been compromised during the period in which the vulnerability existed.

SolarWinds values the privacy and security of its over 300,000 customers and is working closely with customers of its Orion products to address this incident. On December 13, 2020, SolarWinds delivered a communication to approximately 33,000 Orion product customers that were active maintenance customers during and after the Relevant Period. SolarWinds currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000. The communication to these customers contained mitigation steps, including making available a hotfix update to address this vulnerability in part and additional measures that customers could take to help secure their environments. SolarWinds is also preparing a second hotfix update to further address the vulnerability, which SolarWinds currently expects to release on or prior to December 15, 2020. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total revenue from the Orion products across all customers, including those who may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability, was approximately $343 million, or approximately 45% of total revenue.

There has been significant media coverage of attacks on U.S. governmental agencies and other companies, with many of those reports attributing those attacks to a vulnerability in the Orion products. SolarWinds is still investigating whether, and to what extent, a vulnerability in the Orion products was successfully exploited in any of the reported attacks.

SolarWinds uses Microsoft Office 365 for its email and office productivity tools. SolarWinds was made aware of an attack vector that was used to compromise the Company’s emails and may have provided access to other data contained in the Company’s office productivity tools. SolarWinds, in collaboration with Microsoft, has taken remediation steps to address the compromise and is investigating whether further remediation steps are required, over what period of time this compromise existed and whether this compromise is associated with the attack on its Orion software build system. SolarWinds also is investigating in collaboration with Microsoft as to whether any customer, personnel or other data was exfiltrated as a result of this compromise but has uncovered no evidence at this time of any such exfiltration.

SolarWinds’ investigations into these matters are preliminary and on-going, and SolarWinds is still discerning the implications of these security incidents. During the course of these investigations, SolarWinds may become aware of new or different information. At this time, SolarWinds is unable to predict any potential financial, legal or reputational consequences to the Company resulting from this incident, including costs related thereto. So as not to compromise the integrity of any investigations, SolarWinds is unable to share additional information at this time.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739942/000162828020017451/0001628280-20-017451-index.htm,2020-12-14 00:00:00,,Other Events,2020-12-17 00:00:00,"Item 7.01

On December 14, 2020, SolarWinds Corporation (“SolarWinds” or the “Company”) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that it had been made aware of a potential security incident with respect to its Orion monitoring products. On December 17, 2020, SolarWinds provided the following update on the security incident on its Orange Matter corporate blog, accessible at: https://orangematter.solarwinds.com:

On Saturday, December 12, our CEO was advised by an executive at FireEye of a security vulnerability in our Orion Software Platform which was the result of a very sophisticated cyberattack on SolarWinds. We soon discovered that we had been the victim of a malicious cyberattack that impacted our Orion Platform products as well as our internal systems. While security professionals and other experts have attributed the attack to an outside nation-state, we have not independently verified the identity of the attacker.

Immediately after this call, we mobilized our incident response team and quickly shifted significant internal resources to investigate and remediate the vulnerability. Know that each of our 3,200 team members is united in our efforts to meet this challenge. We remain focused on addressing the needs of our customers, our partners and the broader technology industry.

To accomplish that, we swiftly released hotfix updates to impacted customers that we believe will close the code vulnerability when implemented. These updates were made available to all customers we believe to have been impacted, regardless of their current maintenance status. We have reached out and spoken to thousands of customers and partners in the past few days, and we will continue to be in constant communication with our customers and partners to provide timely information, answer questions and assist with upgrades.

We are solely focused on our customers and the industry we serve. Our top priority has been to take all steps necessary to ensure that our and our customers’ environments are secure. We are taking extraordinary measures to accomplish this goal. We shared all of our proprietary code libraries that we believed to have been affected by SUNBURST to give security professionals the information they needed to do their research. We also have had numerous conversations with security professionals to further assist them in their research. We were very pleased and proud to hear that colleagues in the industry discovered a “killswitch” that will prevent the malicious code from being used to create a compromise.

Here are a few important things to know:

•This was a highly sophisticated cyberattack on our systems that inserted a vulnerability within our Orion® Platform products. This particular intrusion is so targeted and complex that experts are referring to it as the SUNBURST attack. The vulnerability has only been identified in updates to the Orion Platform products delivered between March and June 2020, but our investigations are still ongoing. Also, while we are still investigating our non-Orion products, to date we have not seen evidence that they are impacted by SUNBURST.
•The vulnerability was not evident in the Orion Platform products’ source code but appears to have been inserted during the Orion software build process.
•We swiftly released hotfix updates to impacted customers, regardless of their maintenance status, that we believe will close the vulnerability when implemented.
•After our release of Orion 2020.2.1 HF2 on Tuesday night, we believe the Orion Platform now meets the US Federal and state agencies' requirements. We are providing direct support to these customers and will help them complete their upgrades quickly.
•We are continuing to take measures to ensure our internal systems are secure, including deploying the Falcon Endpoint Protection Platform across the endpoints on our systems.
•We have retained industry-leading third-party cybersecurity experts to assist us with this work and are actively collaborating with our partners, vendors, law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world.
We are providing our customers, experts and others in the IT and security industries detailed information regarding the incident to aid with identifying indicators of compromise and steps they can take to further harden their systems against unauthorized incursion. These tools can be found on our Security Advisory page at www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory which we are updating as we learn new information.

Our shared goal is to better understand and protect against these types of malicious attacks in the future.

As we’ve noted, the attacks on our systems were incredibly complex, and it will take some time for our investigative work to be complete. We are committed to being deliberate as we take this on. At the same time, of course, we know that we are the subject of scrutiny and speculation. In order to be as clear as possible, we want to highlight that the exploration by SolarWinds of the potential spinoff of its MSP business and the departure of our CEO, were announced in August 2020. Finally, all sales of stock by executive officers in November were made under pre-established Rule 10b5-1 selling plans and not discretionary sales.

We understand and share our customers’ and the industry’s concerns, and we are grateful for the continued support and understanding that we have received. We will continue to investigate these matters and share what information we can to continually find ways to improve our collective security from these types of attacks.",,,,1:21-cv-00002-RP,Solarwinds Corp,Timothy Bremer,,19.6200008392334,14.640000343322756,17.040000915527347,16.819999694824222,,,,,,,,,,,

FILE PHOTO: The FireEye logo is seen outside the company's offices in Milpitas, California, December 29, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo

The hack of FireEye, a company with an array of contracts across the national security space both in the United States and its allies, is among the most significant breaches in recent memory. The company’s shares dropped 8% in after-hours trading.

The FireEye breach was disclosed in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission citing CEO Kevin Mandia. A blog post by the company here said ""red team tools"" were stolen as part of a highly sophisticated, likely government-backed hacking operation that used previously unseen techniques.

It is not clear exactly when the hack initially took place, but a person familiar with the events said the company has been resetting user passwords over the past two weeks.

Beyond the tool theft, the hackers also appeared to be interested in a subset of FireEye customers: government agencies.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, said he would ask for more information. “We have asked the relevant intelligence agencies to brief the Committee in the coming days about this attack, any vulnerabilities that may arise from it, and actions to mitigate the impacts.”

There is no evidence that FireEye’s hacking tools have been used or that client data was stolen. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Microsoft Corp are helping to look.

“The FBI is investigating the incident and preliminary indications show an actor with a high level of sophistication consistent with a nation state,” said Matt Gorham, assistant FBI director for the Cyber Division.

A former Defense Department official familiar with the case said that Russia was high on the early list of suspects. In the run-up to the U.S. elections, where Russian interference was a prime concern, U.S. officials exposed some Russian hacking techniques.

Other security companies have been successfully hacked before, including Bit9, Kaspersky Lab and RSA, underscoring the difficulty in keeping anything digital away from the most sophisticated hackers.

“Plenty of similar companies have also been popped like this,” said a Western security official who asked not to be named.

“The goal of these operations is typically to collect valuable intelligence that can help them defeat security countermeasures and enable hacking of organizations all over the world,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technology officer at top rival CrowdStrike.

FireEye disclosing what happened and which tools were taken is “helping to minimize the chances of others getting compromised as a result of this breach.”

FireEye said it has been working to shore up defenses against its own tools with different software makers, and it released countermeasures publicly.

Those showed that the tools uses modified versions of public programs, said Vincent Liu, chief executive of security firm Bishop Fox and a former National Security Agency analyst.

The stolen computer kit targets a myriad of different vulnerabilities in popular software products. FireEye CEO Mandia wrote that none of the red team tools exploited so-called “zero-day vulnerabilities,” meaning the relevant flaws should already be public.

Past hacking attacks on government agencies and contractors have captured such higher-value hacking tools, and some of those tools have been published, wrecking their effectiveness as defenses are put in place.

Both the NSA and CIA have been burned this way in the past decade, with Russia a key suspect. Russian and Iranian tools have been hacked and published more recently. Private surveillance software makers have also been targeted. Experts said it is hard to estimate the impact of a tool leak that focuses on known software vulnerabilities, but it could make attackers’ jobs easier.

“Exploitation tools in the wrong hands will lead to more victimization of people who don’t see it coming, and there’s already enough problems like that,” said Paul Ferguson, threat intelligence principal at security company Gigamon. “We don’t really need more exploitation tools floating around making it easier - look at ransomware.”

Whenever private companies learn of a vulnerability in their software products, they often offer a “patch” or upgrade that nullifies the issue. But many users do not install these patches at once, and some do not for months or longer.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370880/000137088020000037/0001370880-20-000037-index.htm,2020-12-08 00:00:00,,Other Events,2020-12-08 00:00:00,"Item 8.01    Other Events.

On December 8, 2020, concurrently with the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, FireEye, Inc. (""FireEye"", “we”, “our” or “us”) is announcing on our corporate blog that FireEye recently was attacked by a highly sophisticated cyber threat actor, one whose discipline, operational security, and techniques lead us to believe it was a state-sponsored attack. Based on his 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, Kevin Mandia, our Chief Executive Officer, concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities. This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years. The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. They are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus. They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past. We are actively investigating in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other key partners, including Microsoft. Their initial analysis supports our conclusion that this was the work of a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.

During our investigation to date, we have found that the attacker targeted and accessed certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers’ security. These tools mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers. None of the tools contain zero-day exploits. Consistent with our goal to protect the community, we are proactively releasing methods and means to detect the use of our stolen Red Team tools. We are not sure if the attacker intends to use our Red Team tools or to publicly disclose them. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we have developed more than 300 countermeasures for our customers, and the community at large, to use in order to minimize the potential impact of the theft of these tools. We have seen no evidence to date that any attacker has used the stolen Red Team tools. We, as well as others in the security community, will continue to monitor for any such activity. At this time, we want to ensure that the entire security community is both aware and protected against the attempted use of these Red Team tools.

Consistent with a nation-state cyber-espionage effort, the attacker primarily sought information related to certain government customers. While the attacker was able to access some of our internal systems, at this point in our investigation, we have seen no evidence that the attacker exfiltrated data from our primary systems that store customer information from our incident response or consulting engagements or the metadata collected by our products in our dynamic threat intelligence systems. If we discover that customer information was taken, we will contact them directly.

Belden says the security breach took place after hackers gained access to a limited number of its file servers.

The intrusion was detected after the company's IT personnel detected unusual activity involving the compromised servers. A subsequent investigation revealed that the intruders had copied data of some current and former employees, as well as limited company information regarding some business partners. 

Belden is now notifying customers and employees whose data it believes was exposed in the incident.

""Safety is always paramount at Belden and we take threats to the privacy of personal and company information very seriously,"" said Roel Vestjens, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We regret any complications or inconvenience this incident may have caused and are offering assistance to those individuals who may have been impacted.""

The company, which makes networking, audio, and video cables, networking racks & cabinets, as well as various cable adapters, said the intrusion did not have any impact on its manufacturing plants, quality control operations, or shipping, all of which are operating normally.

Belden said it's now working with cyber-security firms and law enforcement to investigate the incident.

While many security breaches today have often turned into ransomware attacks, Belden has not made any comment about the intention of the intruders to deploy ransomware.

A Belden spokesperson was not available for comment due to the Thanksgiving four-day weekend in the US.

According to data provided by threat intelligence firm KELA, credentials for Belden accounts have been available on the cybercrime underground since April this year, although it's unclear if they have been used to orchestrate this breach.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913142/000091314220000055/0000913142-20-000055-index.htm,2020-11-24 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,39.810001373291016,41.56999969482422,47.849998474121094,44.209999084472656,43.84000015258789,,,,,,,,,,

However, it seems like Pluto TV has suffered a security breach, with millions of account details from 2018 now available online.

The breach comes from hacking group ShinyHunters, which has previously released customer records from over 17 companies, and was allegedly responsible for breaking into Microsoft's private GitHub repository earlier this year. The Pluto TV database was released for free access by ShinyHunters, and according to BleepingComputer, the records contain display names, email addresses, hashed passwords, birthdays, device platforms, and IP addresses.

Thankfully, the leaked data appears to be old, with the latest record dating back to October 12th, 2018. That's right around the time Pluto started taking off, according to data from Google Trends. Pluto doesn't offer any paid plans, so no credit card information was stolen.

Pluto TV has not yet confirmed the data breach, but it is being investigated. ""While at this time, we cannot verify the veracity of this claim,"" Pluto said in a statement, ""any attempt to compromise the security of our users, platform, or details are treated with the utmost priority.

""Company""), hereby provides this Notice of Security Breach to the New Hampshire
Attorney General in accordance with Title XXXI Section 359-C:20 of the New Hampshire
Statutes.
On September 22 and September 23, 2020, criminal actors committed two brute-force
password attacks on the Company's website, www.winndixie.com, using a method called
credential stuffing. With this type of attack, the bad actors extract login information for a
large number of users from systems they are able to access, and they then use those
usernames and passwords to try and access other systems with the hope that people are using
the same usernames and passwords for multiple accounts. The Company became aware of
the criminal intrusion on the same day of each attack and acted immediately to contain the
attacks by addressing system security to stop the malicious activity. After containing the
attacks the Company began its investigation and all relevant system logs were gathered and
stored for analysis. Shortly after implementing containment measures and updating security
measures that could stop the malicious activity, the Company engaged its forensic incident
response partner to further analyze, review, and verify the details of the incident. During
the course of the Company's investigation, the Company learned that the criminal actors
were able to obtain account login information and related personal information for some of
the Company's customer loyalty accounts.
Those whose loyalty accounts were impacted in the first attack were sent an email from the
Company on September 25, 2020, and those whose loyalty accounts were impacted in the
second attack were sent an email from the Company on October 5, 2020. A copy of the text
of those emails is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Those emails informed customers of the
incident, instructed them that their passwords had been reset to random passwords, and
notified them of how to reset their passwords.
According to the Company's records, there are four (4) New Hampshire residents whose
loyalty accounts were impacted. The Company intends to mail to these four (4) New
Hampshire residents a letter notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B on or before
November 13, 2020. The Company believes that letter notice includes the content required
by Section 359-C:20(IV).
The Company does not collect or store social security numbers or financial information for
its customers who have loyalty accounts. For those Company customers whose loyalty
accounts were accessed as a result of this attack, only the personal information that customer
has provided in connection with the loyalty account could have been compromised, and at
most that information would include the customer's name, phone number, email address,
date of birth, reward number and PIN, recent points transactions, and loyalty account points
balance. This attack was limited to the winndixie.com website; however, the rewards
accounts can be used at all Winn-Dixie, BI-LO, Fresco y Mas and Harveys store locations.
The Company is continuing to thoroughly review the potentially affected systems and files
and is also working closely with forensic investigators, legal counsel and law enforcement
to ensure the incident is properly addressed.
The Company and its Information Security Team have already adopted additional security
measures to help prevent a recurrence of such an attack, and the Company will be
investigating further security measures as it concludes the investigation. Any new security
measures will be designed to protect the privacy of the Company's customers. ", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One customer posted a screenshot of his inbox on Twitter, filled with other people’s order confirmations. The Home Depot replied with a confirmation:

Eventually, more reports surfaced on Twitter. According to emails obtained by BleepingComputer, information was revealed such as the customer's name, order number along with QR code, pick-up store address—or in some cases the customer's home address, items in the order, and payment receipt containing the last 4 digits of the payment card number.

“We often think of data breaches as the consequence of a threat actor infiltrating a network and gaining access to a sensitive data set,” Mounir Hahad, Head of Juniper Threat Labs tells RIS.  “But, according to Verizon DBIR, human error is the third leading cause of data breaches when either policies are set wrong or data is sent to the wrong people.""

Later that night Home Depot replied again on Twitter: “Thank you for reaching out. This systems error has been fixed and impacts a very small number of customers who had placed orders on our Canadian http://Homedepot.ca website. If you haven't already, please send us a DM so that we can help you.”

“We don’t really know how it happened, but it sounds like possibly an internal error,” Chloé Messdaghi, VP of Strategy, Point3 Security, says. “If one of those emails landed in the hands of an attacker, it’s like early Christmas for them. Any attacker would otherwise have to pay big money for real time data on actual orders.

 “Home Depot really needs to get in front of this immediately to beat attackers to the punch. They need to let their consumers know what to do next – and to be especially aware that bad actors may be calling, emailing or texting, displaying the last few digits of their card and recent orders, and asking these consumers to click through to links that will extract valuable information from them, drop ransomware or other malware, or do other damage.

“Merely reporting a breach without informing consumers of attacks they might expect and how to avoid them is like diagnosing a treatable illness but withholding possible treatments. It’s potentially cyber malpractice.”

While the snafu seems to be an internal error, releasing home and email addresses and recent order confirmations could be gold for a malicious actor. 

“While this appears to be a misconfiguration, there are tools available that can identify misconfigured systems and recognize unusual behavior to keep data breaches like this one from happening,” Saryu Nayyar, CEO, Gurucul says.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,269.6300048828125,277.41000366210943,266.19000244140625,270.82000732421875,261.6199951171875,302.20001220703125,,,,,,,,,

This comes just days after the pharmaceutical giant received the approval from the Drugs Controller General of India to conduct the phase 2/3 trials of the Russian vaccine in India.

The company in a statement to the stock exchanges said it has isolated all data centre services in wake of the cyber attack. ""In the wake of a detected cyber-attack, we have isolated all data centre services to take required preventive actions,"" it said. Mukesh Rathi, CIO, Dr Reddy's Laboratories said the company expects to restart all its services in the next 24 hours. ""We are anticipating all services to be up within 24 hours and we do not foresee any major impact on our operations due to this incident,"" said Mukesh.

Dr Reddy's has pharmaceutical plants across India, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Brazil. The cyber-attack, according to reports, happened around 4-5 pm (the US time) or 2.30 am IST last night.

Dr Reddy's has partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct trials and distribute vaccine in India. Earlier, the company had reapplied for the permission of DCGI to conduct these trials of the Russian coronavirus vaccine candidate Sputnik V in India. This will be a multi-centre, observer-blind, randomised and controlled study.

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation's Subject Expert Committee on COVID-19 had earlier this month asked Dr Reddy's to re-apply with a reworked proposal, stating that it cannot directly conduct phase 3 trials in India. The panel suggested the Russian COVID-19 vaccine should be tested for safety and efficacy in a smaller trial first.

The breach related to conversations between Pfizer’s automated customer support software and people using its products like painkiller Lyrica (pregabalin), Chantix (varenicline) used to help people quit smoking, erectile dysfunction therapy Viagra (sildenafil), and cancer treatments Ibrance (palbociclib) and Aromasin (exemestane).

vpnMentor says the unsecured and unencrypted data was leaked from misconfigured Google Cloud storage, and included full names, home addresses and email addresses – potentially exposing patients to phishing attacks and other scams – along with confidential medical information.

Cybersecurity experts led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar discovered the storage “bucket” containing the data as part of an ongoing web mapping project. It included transcripts of conversations as well as follow-ups when queries were “escalated” to support staff.

vpnMentor claim they discovered the breach in July, contacting Pfizer about it shortly after, but didn’t receive a response from the big pharma group until the third week of September, soe two months later.

“Pharmaceutical companies hold a great deal of responsibility to keep the data of their customers secure and private. Not only is this a moral responsibility. It’s the law,” says vpnMentor in its report.

“By exposing these transcripts to the public, Pfizer committed a basic lapse in data security and a breach of confidentiality, with significant implications for the wellbeing of the people exposed.”

A Crown Records Management (CRM) survey reported in 2017 found that around a quarter of respondents in the pharma industry were failing to report data breaches, despite the high level of personal data that drugmakers hold.

That poll suggested 15 per cent of 408 IT decision-maker respondents were unaware of who to report a breach to, while 23 per cent apiece either knew someone within their company who had failed to report a breach, or had failed to do so themselves.

That study took place before the EU introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, which requires personal data breaches to be reported within 72 hours of discovery.

Fines are starting to be levied on organisations who don’t adhere to those requirements. Last December, UK pharmacy chain Doorstep Dispensaree was fined £275,000 for “careless” storage of patient data under the GDPR.

By not securing the data exposed in this breach, Pfizer has made itself vulnerable to legal issues, according to vpnMentor. For example, if any of the individuals affected were residents of California, the company falls within the jurisdiction of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Commenting on the latest report, Sam Curry – chief security officer at cybersecurity specialist Cybereason – said that it shows how difficult it is difficult for even the largest companies in the world to secure their data.

“It's irrelevant whether an internal or external error led to this data breach, because the digital footprint for enterprises is expanding at such a rapid pace that errors will occur and data will be exposed,” he said.

“However, it is incumbent upon Pfizer to continue to do everything humanly possible to protect its IP, customer and partner data and all proprietary information,” he continued.

“In this case, Pfizer can't play the victim card as there certainly aren't any customers interested in hearing excuses,” according to Curry. “What they want is transparency and guarantees that the company will continue to make sure data protection is their top priority.

He said the breach should be a “wake up call” for all companies to improve their security and use threat hunting services to discover malicious operations quickly before material damage occurs.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.56925964355469,36.70000076293945,37.38000106811523,36.5,34.439998626708984,35.529998779296875,,,,,,,,,

In an October 5 update, UHS officials said: “The UHS IT Network has been restored and applications are in the process of being reconnected. The recovery process has been completed for all servers at the corporate data center and connectivity has been re-established for all U.S.-based inpatient facilities.”

“Our major information systems such as the electronic medical record (EMR) were not directly impacted,” officials said in a statement. “W2e are in the process of restoring connections to these systems and back-loading data from the past week.”

“More than half of our Acute Care hospitals are live already or scheduled to be live by the end of today,” they added. “UHS has deployed a significant number of IT and clinical resources to the hospitals, to support the resumption of online operations. The go-lives will continue on a rolling basis; in the meantime, those working toward go-live are continuing to use their established back-up processes including offline documentation methods.”

Hackers launched the cyberattack around 2AM Sunday, September 27, which prompted a number of staff members and clinicians from around the country to take to Reddit to determine the scope of the attack. The thread detailed outages to computer systems, phone services, the internet, and data centers. 
Some hospitals diverted ambulances during the initial stages of the attack, and some lab test results were delayed. According to staff, the attack began shutting down systems in the emergency department and proliferating across the network. Staff took screenshots of the incident and confirmed it was ransomware. The notorious Ryuk variant is suspected. 

UHS officials reported the incident as an IT disruption the following day and has since update the notification to confirm it was a malware cyberattack. 

“All systems were quickly disconnected, and the network was shut down in order to prevent further propagation,” officials explained in the statement. “The UHS IT Network is in the process of being restored and applications are being reconnected.” 

“The recovery process has been completed for all servers at the corporate data center. All US-based inpatient facilities have connectivity established back to the corporate data center and are in process of securely connecting to those systems,” they added. 

Officials also noted that the electronic medical record was not directly impacted by the ransomware, nor were the UK-based sites. The restoration efforts are focused on the connections to the EMR system. Clinicians are continuing to operate under back-up processes, including offline documentation methods. 
Patient care is safely and effectively continuing amid the recovery efforts, officials added. The notification did not detail the ransomware variant, nor when the recovery efforts would conclude.

Security researcher Bob Diachenko received a tip from a contact, Sami Toivonen, about an unprotected server containing almost a terabyte of spreadsheets representing years of internal company data, including financial records and personal customer records. But because there was no password on the server, anyone could access the files inside.

The server was exposed for almost a year, Diachenko told TechCrunch.

Town Sports pulled the server offline a short time after Diachenko contacted the company. He shared his findings exclusively with TechCrunch, which independently verified the authenticity of the data by confirming with customers details found in the spreadsheets.

Spreadsheets found on the server contained customer names, postal addresses, email addresses and phone numbers. The data also contained when a customer checks-in and at which gym location. Some also had notes on customer accounts, such as complaints and when customers were past due on a missed membership payment.

Chief executive Patrick Walsh did not respond to several requests for comment, which also asked if the company planned to inform customers of the security lapse.

Town Sports was forced to shutter its 185 gyms on the U.S. east coast after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in mid-March. By the end of March, the company told financial regulators it had about 588,000 members.

One of the spreadsheets found on the exposed server showed that Town Sports had just 7,100 paying customers by mid-May, while 566,000 customers had their gym memberships frozen.

Town Sports began freezing accounts and refunding membership fees after the company continued to charge customers even after the lockdown began, a move that drew a threat of legal action from New York attorney general Letitia James, who accused the gym chain of “ripping off” its members.

The same spreadsheet still had customer data on some 665,000 cancelled accounts.

Earlier this month the gym chain filed for bankruptcy, just as states began allowing gyms to reopen, albeit with reduced capacity and safety measures in place.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,0.059999998658895486,0.14000000059604645,0.12999999523162842,0.2800000011920929,0.3700000047683716,0.3400000035762787,,,,,,,,

In an email seen by BleepingComputer, Tyler Technologies CIO Matt Bieri emailed clients stating that they are investigating a cyberattack and have notified law enforcement.


 
""I am writing to make you aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our internal phone and information technology systems by an unknown third party. We are treating this matter with the highest priority and working with independent IT experts to conduct a thorough investigation and response.""

""Early this morning, we became aware that an unauthorized intruder had disrupted access to some of our internal systems. Upon discovery and out of an abundance of caution, we shut down points of access to external systems and immediately began investigating and remediating the problem. We have since engaged outside IT security and forensics experts to conduct a detailed review and help us securely restore affected equipment. We are implementing enhanced monitoring systems, and we have notified law enforcement,"" Bieri stated in an email to clients.

Bieri also stated that current investigations indicate that the attack was limited to Tyler Technologies' local network.

In posts to the Municipal Information Systems Association of California (MISAC) forum shared with BleepingComputer, local government employees were told that Tyler Technologies suffered a ransomware attack affecting their phone ticketing system and support systems.

""We were told this morning from one of the support techs that they got hit with ransomware early this morning on their corporate networks. Don't have any other details at this point other than support is down until they access their systems,"" one local municipality employee posted to the MISAC forum.


Another MISAC user stated that they heard the attack was limited to Tyler Technologies' internal network and did not affect clients.

Tyler technologies hit by RansomExx ransomware
Cybersecurity sources familiar with the attack told BleepingComputer that Tyler Technologies suffered an attack by the RansomExx ransomware.


 
RansomExx is a rebranded version of the Defray777 ransomware and has seen increased activity since June when they attacked the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Konica Minolta, and most recently IPG Photonics.

While BleepingComputer has not obtained the ransom note, we found an encrypted file uploaded to VirusTotal today related to this attack.

This encrypted file has an extension of '.tylertech911-f1e1a2ac,' which includes Tyler Technologies' name and is the same format used in other RansomExx attacks.

RansomExx does not have a ransomware data leak site, but that does not mean they do not steal unencrypted files before deploying their ransomware.

Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Equinix specializes in data centers and Internet connection. In fact, the company happens to be the largest provider of data centers.

quinix hit by a ransomware

On September 9, 2020, Equinix disclosed a security breach, which it said involved a ransomware incident. Equinix said it took action to address the incident and notified law enforcement. According to an initial statement posted on the website, Equinix continued to investigate the issue while all its services continued to remain functional.

This ransomware incident has had zero impact on the data center operations of most customers as well as their. In an updated statement dated September 13, 2020, Equinix had this to say:

    “At this time, our investigation is centered on information related to our internal business. The incident continues to have no impact on our customers’ operations or the data on their equipment at Equinix.”

Equinix impacted by Netwalker Ransomware

According to reports, Netwalker Ransomware is responsible for the data breach incident targeting Equinix data centers. Let’s take a look at what the Netwalker Ransomware is all about. Netwalker is a fairly new form of a ransomware attack. For those who don’t know, Netwalker Ransomware wasn’t discovered before August 2019.

Netwalker ransomware largely targets devices running Microsoft’s Windows operating system connected to the networks. It manages to encrypt devices connected to a network by breaching its security. Once executed, Netwalker relies on an embedded configuration that comprises a note describing the operator’s demand.

There are two ways Netwalker ransomware spreads across networks: A VBS script attached to phishing emails and an executable file spread over a network. In the past, Netwalker operators have tried to lure victims by sending out coronavirus-related phishing emails.

Equinix is spread across more than 50 locations. The company provides its customers with data centers so that they can colocate their network equipment. What’s more, these data centers can also be used to integrate services from other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network providers.",https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1101239/000119312520242557/d847756d8k.htm,2020-09-10 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,741.0499877929688,824.4000244140625,743.2100219726562,695.280029296875,692.4600219726562,747.4099731445312,594.9199829101562,,,,,,,,

R1 RCM was formerly known as Accretive Health and is one of the largest medical debt collections firms in the US. The company has partnered with over 750 healthcare companies. In 2019, the vendor reported revenues totaling $1.18 billion.  

The vendor has yet to comment on what systems were impacted during the attack, but the vendors has access to patient registration information, billing and collections data, and medical diagnostics data, among other sensitive patient information. 

R1 RCM declined to name the type of ransomware used in the attack, but reports point to the variant known as Defray. First detected in the wild in 2017, Defray was seen targeting the healthcare and education sectors by Proofpoint. 

The ransomware commonly spreads via malicious Microsoft Word documents in emails sent through small phishing campaigns. The lures were tailored to potential victims, with narrow and selective targeting. 

“Defray Ransomware is somewhat unusual in its use in small, targeted attacks,” researchers explained. “Although we are beginning to see a trend of more frequent targeting in ransomware attacks, it still remains less common than large-scale “spray and pray” campaigns.” 

“It is also likely that Defray is not for sale, either as a service or as a licensed application like many ransomware strains,” they added. 

This is the second major security incident on a medical debt collections firm in the last year. The American Medical Collection Agency hack was the largest healthcare data breach of 2019, impacting millions of patient records from Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, and others. The breach prompted several regulatory investigations and forced the company to file for bankruptcy.

Ritz London added that this may have led to the compromise of ""some of our clients' personal data.""

While the hotel said that the security incident did not include any credit card details or payment information, the leaked data may have been used in a social engineering scam designed to steal more valuable financial information -- straight from the source. 

As reported by the BBC, scammers have phoned Ritz restaurant reservation holders with the ""exact"" details of their bookings, while requesting the confirmation of their payment card details. 

The fraudsters, pretending to be Ritz employees, used call ID spoofing to appear to be from the hotel. 

One guest speaking to the publication said a scammer called her a day before she was due to visit the Ritz for afternoon tea. After requesting that she ""confirm"" her details, the fraudster said her card had been declined and then requested a second payment card. 

Information in hand, the scam artist then tried to make a number of transactions exceeding £1000 from retailer Argos. 

However, the guest's bank spotted the odd payments. Perhaps aware this was likely to happen, the scammer then called again -- but this time, pretended to be from her bank in order to obtain the three-digit security code from the back of the payment card, which would authorize future transactions made. 

Another woman told the BBC that the same tactics were used on her, but she dismissed the call after the fraudster on the other end of the line was not able to provide details relating to the hotel -- knowledge that a true employee would possess.  

It is not known how widespread this scam is, or how many people have been targeted. The Ritz hotel has emailed customers, emphasizing that staff will not call them after a reservation is made. 

""We immediately launched an investigation to identify the cause of the breach, which is ongoing, to find out what happened, how and to prevent this from happening again,"" the hotel chain says. 

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has been informed of the security incident.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,95.72000122070312,107.76000213623048,97.76000213623048,123.76000213623048,130.44000244140622,126.8000030517578,130.39999389648438,150.6300048828125,,,,,,,

This time the victim is Brown-Forman, the 150-year-old Kentucky-based company behind such brands as Jack Daniel’s, Finlandia vodka and Korbel champagne.

According to a statement published by the attacks, the REvil crew had access to Brown-Forman’s systems for over a month. In that time they were able to methodically explore systems and devices. Not even the company’s cloud-based services were out of reach.

The situation doesn’t look good, but it could have been a lot worse. Speaking to Bleeping Computer, a Brown-Forman representative said that the company detected the attack and intervened before any data could be encrypted.

File-encrypting ransomware has been plaguing victims for decades now. In recent years, criminal hackers have developed and deployed increasingly sophisticated strains. Attacks that once primarily targeted end users are now being carefully planned and launched against governments and billion-dollar corporations.

Kottmann received the Intel leaks because he manages a very popular Telegram channel where he regularly publishes data that accidentally leaked online from major tech companies through misconfigured Git repositories, cloud servers, and online web portals.

The Swiss engineer said today's leak represents the first part of a multi-part series of Intel-related leaks.

ZDNet reviewed the content of today's files with security researchers who have previously analyzed Intel CPUs in past work, who deemed the leak authentic but didn't want to be named in this article due to ethical concerns of reviewing confidential data, and because of their ongoing relations with Intel.

Per our analysis, the leaked files contained Intel intellectual property respective to the internal design of various chipsets.

BleepingComputer has been tracking a suspicious outage on Canon's image.canon cloud photo and video storage service resulting in the loss of data for users of their free 10GB storage feature.

The image.canon site suffered an outage on July 30th, 2020, and over six days, the site would show status updates until it went back in service yesterday, August 4th.

However, the final status update was strange as it mentions that while data was lost, ""there was no leak of image data.""  This led BleepingComputer to believe there was more to the story and that they suffered a cyberattack.

What Happened?
Our ongoing investigation into a phishing email incident recently determined that an unauthorized individual
gained access to a Dynavax employee’s email account for a brief period of time on February 28, 2020. Upon
identifying the incident, we immediately secured the account and a leading computer forensic firm was engaged
to assist with our investigation. A review of available data shows no further unauthorized access to the account
occurred. While we have identified employee information in the email account, our investigation has not shown
that the unauthorized person stole or misused or attempted to misuse any personal information from the account.

The incident took place in May 2020, the company revealed in a press release on Thursday.

Blackbaud said hackers breached its network and attempted to install ransomware in order to lock the company's customers out of their data and servers.

""After discovering the attack, our Cyber Security team-together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement-successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from our system,"" the company said.

However, Blackbaud says that before being pushed out of their network, the hackers managed to steal a subset of data from its ""self-hosted environment,"" where customers save their files.

The ransomware gang, which ZDNet was not able to identify before this article's publication, then threatened to release the stolen data unless Blackbaud paid a ransom demand -- even if their initial file-encrypting attack was stopped.

""Because protecting our customers' data is our top priority, we paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed,"" Blackbaud said.

""Based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly,"" it added.

The cloud provider, which primarily works with non-profits, foundations, educational, and healthcare, said the incident only impacted the data of only a small subset of its customers, which they have now notified.

RANSOMWARE TREND
The Blackbaud incident is an epitome of today's double-extortion ransomware attacks.

Ransomware gangs now primarily focus their attacks on large corporate networks, where they gain an initial foothold, and steal the victim's data before encrypting the local files.

Victims are then prompted to pay a ransom demand -- either for unlocking the files or for preventing their stolen data from being published online (in case the victim refuses to pay the decryption fee and chooses to restore from backups or rebuild systems from scratch).

Such attacks have been the norm since around late 2019 when a large number of ransomware gangs started operating ""leak sites"" where they'd publish the data of victims who refused to pay.

Ransomware gangs who did not bother creating ""leak sites"" simply dumped the stolen data on file-sharing portals and shared the links on forums, social media networks, or with news agencies.

In the vast majority of cases, ransomware groups have usually pursued one of the two ransom fees (for decrypting files or for not publishing the data), but one gang, in particular, is known for chasing both at the same time -- namely the Ako ransomware gang.",https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1280058/000128005820000044/blkb-20200929.htm,2020-09-29 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1280058/000128005820000038/0001280058-20-000038-index.htm,Risk factors | Footnotes,2020-08-04 00:00:00,"If the security of our software is breached, we fail to securely collect, store and transmit customer information, or we fail to safeguard confidential donor data, we could be exposed to liability, litigation, penalties and remedial costs and our reputation and business could suffer.
Fundamental to the use of our solutions is the secure collection, storage and transmission of confidential donor and end user data and transaction data, including in our payment services. Despite the network and application security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures we employ to safeguard our systems, we may still be vulnerable to a security breach, intrusion, loss or theft of confidential donor data and transaction data, which may harm our business, reputation and future financial results.
Like many major businesses, we are, from time to time, a target of cyber-attacks and phishing schemes, and we expect these threats to continue. Because of the numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.
A compromise of our data security that results in customer or donor personal or payment card data being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations and expenses related to remediating our information security systems. Even though we carry cyber-technology insurance policies that may provide insurance coverage under certain circumstances, we might suffer losses as a result of a security breach that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. A security breach and any efforts we make to address such breach could also result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.
Further, the existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm client confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remedy such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited, which may harm our business, reputation and future financial results.

On July 16, 2020, we contacted certain customers to inform them about a recent security incident. Our communication to these customers included the information that in May 2020 we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our cybersecurity team—together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement—successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files, and ultimately expelled them from our system with no significant disruption to our operations. Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out of our system, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment. This incident did not involve solutions in our public cloud environment (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services), nor did it involve the majority of our self-hosted environment. Based on the nature of the incident, our research and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Most of our customers were not part of the incident. The subset of customers who were part of this incident have been notified and supplied with additional information and resources. Our investigation into the incident by our cybersecurity team and third-party forensic advisors remains ongoing. It is expected that we will continue to experience increased costs related to our response to this incident and our efforts to further enhance our security measures. In addition, it is possible that the incident may result in loss of customers and partners, harm our reputation, increased costs to maintain insurance coverage, devotion of substantial management time, litigation or regulatory enforcement, claims for indemnification obligations, future cybersecurity attacks and other potential liabilities.",0,,,,,,,53.43999862670898,63.209999084472656,56.97999954223633,58.06000137329102,52.29999923706055,57.38000106811523,63.709999084472656,72.91000366210938,71.76000213623047,,,,,,

Twitter accounts with millions of followers seemed to have been compromised, raising concerns about whether the company is doing enough to protect the security of its users. While cryptocurrency scams aren't a new problem for Twitter, the size of Wednesday's attack is unusual.

This is the scam tweet sent from Bill Gates' account. (The Bitcoin address has been removed from this screenshot.)

Screenshot by Ian Sherr/CNET
Similar tweets were sent through the Twitter account belonging to Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder. ""I am doubling all payments sent to my BTC address for the next 30 minutes. You send $1,000, I send you back $2,000,"" the tweet, which was deleted, read.

The scam tweets would periodically vanish, only to reappear minutes later. 

A spokesperson for Gates confirmed the tweet wasn't sent by the billionaire.

""We can confirm that this tweet was not sent by Bill Gates. This appears to be part of a larger issue that Twitter is facing. Twitter is aware and working to restore the account,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. 

Obama's account tweeted a similar message shared by Musk and Gates. In a tweet sent to his 120 million followers, Obama's account tweeted that he was giving back because of the novel coronavirus and he would double all bitcoin sent to his address for the next 30 minutes.

It wasn't immediately clear how the hack was conducted or how many accounts were impacted, although Twitter did provide an update late Wednesday indicating that while it's investigation into the hack was ongoing, it had determined it to be the result of a ""coordinated social engineering attack.""

""We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools,"" Twitter said in a tweet.  (For tips on how to secure your Twitter account, see this CNET story.)


But for the hack's first two hours, Twitter still didn't have a handle on the incident. In a tweet, the company said some users might not be able to tweet or reset their password as they review and tackle the problem. Twitter also began removing tweets of screenshots showing internal tools that were possibly used in the attack.


Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday evening that it was ""a tough day for us at Twitter"" and promised to share the company's findings when it completed its diagnosis of the hack.


Some users who tried to tweet got an error message, this appeared to apply only to verified users with ""blue checks"". 

""This request looks like it might be automated. To protect our users from spam and other malicious activity, we can't complete this action now. Please try again later,"" the message read. Twitter didn't respond to questions about whether only verified accounts couldn't tweet. 

Twitter has now removed this restriction. Users with verified accounts are now able to tweet again, but Twitter Support stated that functionality may ""come and go"".


""We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,"" the tweet read.

The scam tweets end with a link where unsuspecting readers can send Bitcoin. As of Wednesday afternoon, a spot check of the BTC address from the tweets shows a total received of 12.30776555 BTC, roughly $113,572.

The Wednesday hack isn't the first time that Twitter accounts have been compromised by scammers. In 2018, hackers took control of the verified Twitter accounts of Target and Google's G-Suite. Twitter said that hackers in that attack exploited a third-party marketing service, not its own system. Twitter then banned cryptocurrency ads, but that hasn't stopped scammers from coming back to the platform. 


Even Dorsey hasn't been immune from hacking. In 2019, Dorsey's account was compromised and the hackers tweeted out sexist, racist and anti-Semitic comments. Twitter said there was a security issue with Dorsey's mobile provider that allowed the hackers to compose and send tweets from his account via text message. In a tactic known as SIM swapping, a hacker bribes an employee of a mobile provider to get them to switch the numbers tied to the SIM card. That allows them to bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication. 

Politicians on Wednesday were urging others not to fall for the Bitcoin scam and some reached out to Dorsey for answers. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, asked Dorsey in a letter to respond to questions such as whether the attack threatened the security of President Donald Trump's account and its impact on the security of other users.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" he said in the letter.  ""A successful attack on your system's servers represents a threat to all of your users' privacy and data security.""

Musk and Gates weren't the only high-profile accounts that appear to have been compromised. Scammy tweets were seen in the feeds for fast food chain Wendy's, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, philanthropist Warren Buffett, musician Wiz Khalifa, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and celebrity Kim Kardashian. Scammers also appear to have targeted athletes, such as former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather and even a popular parody account for God, along with cryptocurrency businesses.


""ALL MAJOR CRYPTO TWITTER ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED,"" tweeted Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. ""We are investigating and hope to have more information shortly.""

""WARNING: @Gemini's twitter account, along with a number of other crypto twitter accounts, has been hacked,"" added Tyler Winklevoss, echoing his twin brother and Gemini co-founder's concern. ""This has resulted in @Gemini, @coinbase, @binance, and @CoinDesk, tweeting about a scam partnership with CryptoForHealth. DO NOT CLICK THE LINK! These tweets are SCAMS.""

Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In the US, #hacked was trending along with Bitcoin and #twitterhacked.

It is not believed that non-business Twitter users are affected.

It's not the first time Twitter has been exposed to a data breach.

Honda has confirmed a cyber attack on its networks that is widely believed to have involved deployment of the “Snake” ransomware.

The £22 billion by market capitalisation automotive giant has admitted that production, sales and development activities are all hit.

Chatter on social networks suggests production globally has been stopped. Computer Business Review could not immediately confirm this.


Samples analysed by Malwarebytes
The attack comes after Honda last year left an Elasticsearch database exposed to the public, with upwards of 40GB of data relating to the firm’s internal systems and devices spotted by security researchers.

Security researcher Justin Paine, who spotted the database on Shodan, said at the time: “The information available in the database appeared to be something like a inventory of all internal machines.

“This included information such as machine hostname, MAC address, internal IP, operating system version, which patches had been applied, and the status of Honda’s endpoint security software.”

Mass scanning for exposed factory automation end-points meanwhile, is common place; the threat vector could have been anything; it is unclear how poorly segmented networks were, but Honda appears to have had some machines with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access publicly exposed. RDP is a common threat vector for ransomware operations.

Honda Hacked: “Minimal Business Impact”
“Honda can confirm that a cyber attack has taken place on the Honda network,” a spokesperson said late Tuesday.

“We can also confirm that there is no information breach at this point in time. Work is being undertaken to minimize the impact and to restore full functionality of production, sales and development activities. At this point, we see minimal business impact”.

Honda shipped 4.7 million vehicles over the past 12 months.

The company’s Twitter feed shows that both Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services, the company’s lending arm, are “experiencing technical difficulties and are unavailable”.

Customers facing issues with their vehicles are being urged to DM their full name, VIN, mileage, address, email, best contact number and other details through to Honda on Twitter. (This has already back-fired at least once, with a customer posting all of these publicly rather than via DM).

Josh Smith, a security analyst at Nuspire, said: “EKANS (SNAKE) Ransomware was identified around the end of 2019 and while the ransomware itself wasn’t very sophisticated, what made it interesting was that it had additional functionality programmed into it to forcibly stop processes, especially items involving Industrial Control Systems (ICS) operations.

He added: “A sample of SNAKE was uploaded to VirusTotal from Japan that attempts to connect to mds[.]honda[.]com. This would appear to be an internal domain for Honda. Furthermore, if a DNS request to the internal domain doesn’t resolve, the sample wouldn’t execute. This is similar to the attack on Fresenius who fell victim to SNAKE, where a DNS query to ads[.]fresenius[.]com resolved to a private IP.”

Network segmentation may have been minimal.

As one commentator on Reddit notes: “Back in 2000 it was not considered important to isolate the ICS network and often times facilities wanted to integrate it in with the rest of the network so that management could run reports and check the production levels of the floor.

“Given that the people who are/were in charge of the floor equipment were at best Controls Engineers and at worst over worked, under-trained skilled maintenance workers there often was not much resistance given from a security perspective. Often the IT teams at the facilities were not security personnel either. They would have looked at the cost of implementing security, if it was brought up, and would most likely have chosen to just do recovery instead of protection”.

Sam Curry, chief security officer at Boston’s Cybereason, added: “With any cyber attack, the devil is in the details and that is certainly the case with Honda…. Today, the harsh reality is that strategic ransomware attacks are on the rise, and if the attackers are holding out for a hefty ransom they might have embedded themselves deeply enough inside Honda to create a challenge for remediation in the short term.

“It would be unfair to further speculate on this outcome, but know that increasing security hygiene and rolling out security awareness training to employees is essential. Utilising threat hunting services around the clock will also increase the likelihood that companies which find themselves in the same spot at Honda down the road will be able to more effectively respond and reduce the downtown of networks and the overall operation of their company. Essentially, downtime means a loss in dollars.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,28.09000015258789,25.670000076293945,24.670000076293945,25.35000038146973,24.809999465942386,26.36000061035156,29.809999465942386,28.170000076293945,28.76000022888184,29.479999542236328,,,,,

Conduent, a $4.4 billion by revenue (2019) IT services giant, has admitted that a ransomware attack hit its European operations — but says it managed to restore most systems within eight hours.

Conduent, which says it provides services (including HR and payments infrastructure) for “a majority of Fortune 100 companies and over 500 governments”, was hit on Friday, May 29.

“Conduent’s European operations experienced a service interruption on Friday, May 29, 2020. Our system identified ransomware, which was then addressed by our cybersecurity protocols.

“This interruption began at 12.45 AM CET on May 29th with systems mostly back in production again by 10.00 AM CET that morning, and all systems have since then been restored,” said spokesman Sean Collins.

He added: “This resulted in a partial interruption to the services that we provide to some clients. As our investigation continues, we have on-going internal and external security forensics and anti-virus teams reviewing and monitoring our European infrastructure.”

Conduent Ransomware Attack: Maze Posts Stolen Data
The company did not name the ransomware type or intrusion vector, but the Maze ransomware group has posted stolen Conduent data including apparent customer audits to its Dark Web page.

Security researchers at Bad Packets say Conduent, which employs 67,000 globally, was running unpatched Citrix VPNs for “at least” eight weeks. (An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Citrix VPN appliances, known as CVE-2019-19781, has been widely exploited in the wild by ransomware gangs.)

In early January Bad Packets found nearly 10,000 vulnerable hosts running the unpatched VPN were identified in the US and over 2,000 in the UK. Citrix pushed out firmware updates on January 24.

The malware used by Maze is a binary file of 32 bits, usually packed as an EXE or a DLL file, according to a March 2020 McAfee analysis, which noted that the Maze ransomware can also terminate debugging tools used to analyse its behaviour, including the IDA debugger, x32dbg, OllyDbg and more processes, “to avoid dynamic analysis… and security tools”.

Cyber criminals have largely moved away from “spray and pray”-style attacks on organisations to more targeted intrusions, exploiting weak credentials, unpatched software, or using phishing. They typically sit in a network gathering data to steal and use to blackmail their victims before actually triggering the malware that locks down end-points.

The attack follows hot on the heels of another successful Maze breach of fellow IT services firm Cognizant in April.

Cybersecurity incident

During the course of March 2020, the Company, its subsidiaries, jointly controlled and affiliated companies were subject to a ransomware cyberattack that caused a partial and temporary interruption of its operations. The affected entities within our group implemented their contingency plans, continued operating partially during the cyberattack, and have been progressively reconnecting their operating systems since the attack.

Following the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks, including engaging a company to carry out a forensic analysis of the cyber-attack we suffered, which affected the data center located at our Shared Service Center as well as user desktops and laptops connected to our network. Based on the experience and tools of the company we engaged, interviews with our information technology personnel and technical evidence present in the environment, we identified a number of servers to be examined in more detail. Although the entrance vector of the cyber-attack could not be identified, the process and characteristics of the cyber-attack could be satisfactorily identified. We believe this will assist us in reviewing our information technology systems to prevent further cyber-attacks.

While we have no
evidence that your information was actually used, we take this event very seriously and we feel it is important to inform
you of what happened, what we have done in response and what you can do to help protect yourself. Please read this
letter carefully and contact us with any questions as instructed below.
What Happened
On or about April 6, 2020, we discovered that an unauthorized actor had gained access to an employee’s email
account. Promptly after discovering the unauthorized access, access to the employee’s email account was blocked. Our
investigation revealed that the actor obtained access to the email account on or about approximately March 13, 2020,
and that the access ceased on or before April 4, 2020. We have engaged a forensics firm to determine whether and to
what extent information in the account may have accessed or acquired.
Our investigation has determined the compromised email account contained personal information relating to you. We have
no evidence that the intruder used or disseminated your information or that obtaining such information was the reason for
the intrusion. Furthermore, as of today, our forensic consultant firm confirmed that the information exposed to the intruder
could not be located on any of the typical websites known to store or sell misappropriated personal information.
What Information Was Involved
While the type of information stored on the compromised email account varied from person to person, the information
generally included some combination of name, employee ID number, driver’s license number, financial account number, date
of birth, address, work location, compensation and benefit information, dates of employment, and Social Security number.
What We Are Doing
To prevent similar occurrences from happening in the future, we are taking security measures to further bolster the
security of the information we hold. We have not delayed this notification as a result of a law enforcement investigation.
What You Can Do
We encourage you to take preventative measures now to help prevent and detect any misuse of your information such
as placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on your credit file, performing a review of your credit reports, and enrolling
in free identity monitoring services.
A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. As soon
as one credit reporting agency confirms your fraud alert, the other major agencies are notified to place similar fraud
alerts on your credit file. You may also decide to request a security freeze, which prevents a credit reporting agency from
releasing your credit report without your consent. You may contact any one of the three major credit reporting agencies
or the Federal Trade Commission to obtain additional information about fraud alerts and/or security freezes.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,49.95000076293945,47.0099983215332,49.97000122070313,49.40999984741211,48.02000045776367,50.02999877929688,50.0,50.9900016784668,56.86000061035156,63.88000106811523,54.72999954223633,,,,

For the past week, a hacking group known as Shiny Hunters has been busy selling a steady stream of user databases from alleged data breaches.

It started last weekend with Tokopedia, Indonesia's largest online store, where a database of over 90 million user records was being sold.


Soon after, Shiny Hunters began selling a database of 22 million user records for Unacademy, one of India's largest online learning platforms. After being contacted by BleepingComputer, the company released a statement that their company was breached.


On Wednesday, Shiny Hunters continued their rampage by claiming to hack into Microsoft's GitHub account earlier this year and leaking files from the company's private source code repositories.

While Microsoft has not officially admitted that their GitHub account was breached, sources have told BleepingComputer that the shared data was indeed private repositories only accessible to Microsoft employees.

Now selling user records from 11 data breaches
Earlier this week, BleepingComputer was told by cyber intelligence firm ZeroFox that Shiny Hunters had begun selling databases for the meal kit delivery service HomeChef, photo print service ChatBooks, and Chronicle.com, a news source for higher education.

Chatbooks breach

With the three databases combined, there are a total of 26 million accounts being sold with initial prices for each database ranging between $1,500 and $2,500. Some of the prices have changed since then (e.g. for the ChatBooks records, the initial offer increased to $3,500).


 
Soon after reporting on these breaches, ChatBooks started sending data breach notifications to their users.

Last night, cyber intelligence firm Cyble told BleepingComputer that Shiny Hunters had started to ""flood the market"" with new data breaches from other companies, bringing the total amount of user databases being sold to 11.

With more than 19 million customers, 77 million domains managed, and millions of websites hosted, most everyone has heard of GoDaddy. According to Bleeping Computer, which broke the news yesterday evening, an as yet unknown number of customers have been informed that their web hosting account credentials had been compromised.

What is known so far about the GoDaddy data breach?
The confirmation of the data breach, in an email signed by GoDaddy CISO and vice-president of engineering, Demetrius Comes, revealed that the security incident in question came to light after suspicious activity was recently identified on some GoDaddy servers. The breach itself appears to have occurred on October 19, 2019, according to the State of California Department of Justice, with which the disclosure notification email sample was filed.

The email notification stated that, upon an investigation of the incident, it was determined that an ""unauthorized individual"" had gained access to login credentials that meant they could ""connect to SSH"" on the affected hosting accounts. SSH is an acronym for secure shell, a network protocol used by system administrators to access remote computers. SSH is, as you might imagine then, quite a useful attack vector for hackers. If you want to dive into the technical detail, then Hackaday has an excellent article about the ""terminal program that talks to a server using an encrypted connection.""

""The GoDaddy breach underlines just how important SSH security is,"" Yana Blachman, a threat intelligence specialist at Venafi, said. ""SSH is used to access an organisation’s most critical assets, so it’s vital that organisations stick to the highest security level of SSH access and disable basic credential authentication, and use machine identities instead,"" Blachman said, ""this involves implementing strong private-public key cryptography to authenticate a user and a system.""

Which GoDaddy accounts are affected by the breach?
Importantly, the GoDaddy email said that the breach is limited only to hosting accounts and did not involve customer accounts or the personal information stored within them. It noted that no evidence was found to suggest that any files were modified or added to the affected accounts but fell short of mentioning if files had been viewed or copied. However, all impacted hosting account logins have been reset, and the email contained the procedure customers need to follow in order to regain access to the hosting accounts concerned. GoDaddy has also recommended, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" that users audit their hosting accounts.

However, the investigation into this incident is far from over. While the attacker has been ""blocked from our systems,"" the email said, it also stated that GoDaddy is continuing to determine any potential impact across its environment. Information is scarce, at this stage, beyond what I've already detailed. I have reached out to GoDaddy with regards to how many accounts were affected and will update this article once I have an official response.

GoDaddy to provide free security services to those affected
Meanwhile, GoDaddy has said it will provide a complimentary years’ worth of security and malware removal services for those customers affected, and has expressed ""regret this incident occurred.""

This is the second notable security GoDaddy incident to be reported within the space of just a few weeks. On March 31, former Washington Post journalist Brian Krebs detailed how a GoDaddy employee ""had fallen victim to a spear-phishing attack,"" that led to the hacking of a small number of GoDaddy domain customers.

I have now heard back from a GoDaddy spokesperson with the following statement confirming the total number of accounts affected and the date that the company identified the credentials compromise:

""On April 23, 2020, we identified SSH usernames and passwords had been compromised by an unauthorized individual in our hosting environment. This affected approximately 28,000 customers. We immediately reset these usernames and passwords, removed an authorized SSH file from our platform, and have no indication the individual used our customers’ credentials or modified any customer hosting accounts. The individual did not have access to customers’ main GoDaddy accounts.""", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,66.80999755859375,79.13999938964844,71.30000305175781,73.2300033569336,79.5199966430664,77.08999633789062,79.77999877929688,83.87000274658203,81.77999877929688,86.54000091552734,76.23999786376953,,,82.0,82.22222222222223

While our investigation is ongoing, we believe we have contained the attack. Based on the investigation to date, we believe the attack principally impacted certain of our systems and data. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruption to our business. This included the disabling of some of our systems and disruption caused by our taking certain other internal systems and networks offline as a precautionary measure. The attack compounded the challenges we face in enabling work-from-home arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in setbacks and delays to such efforts. The impact to clients and their responses to the security incident have varied. Some clients experienced no disruption. As to other clients, we experienced service disruptions due to our reliance on certain of the impacted systems and networks to perform work for clients and the impact to our systems and networks supporting work-from-home capabilities. The systems that comprise the technology platforms that support our business process-as-a-service solutions were not impacted. Most clients maintained connectivity with our network, allowing us to continue to provide service, but some clients opted to suspend our access to their networks as a security precaution. In this circumstance, we are unable to continue providing services via client networks until access is restored. We engaged leading outside forensics and cybersecurity experts, launched a comprehensive containment and remediation effort and forensic investigation, and are working on restoring and ensuring the security of our internal systems and networks, including through the adoption of various security enhancements. We also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement.
We expect the business disruption caused by and incremental costs resulting from the ransomware attack to adversely impact our financial results primarily with respect to the second quarter of 2020. We have and expect to continue to experience a loss of revenue due to the interruption in our ability to provide services to some clients, either as a direct consequence of the attack or as a result of clients suspending our access to their networks as a security precaution, and incur incremental costs for the investigation, containment and remediation of the security incident, including legal and other professional fees, and investments to enhance our overall security environment. The lost revenue and containment, investigation, remediation, legal and other costs will be significant and may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all. Other actual and potential consequences include, but are not limited to, negative publicity, reputational damage, lost trust with customers, regulatory enforcement action, litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage.

Key Ring allows users to upload scans and photos of membership and loyalty cards onto a digital folder on one’s phone. However, many users also use it to store copies of IDs, driver licenses, credit cards, and more.

A misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket owned by the company exposed these uploads and revealed their owners’ private data. During the team’s investigation, they also found four additional unsecured S3 buckets belonging to Key Ring, exposing even more sensitive data as they were publicly accessible to anyone with a web browser. 

These unsecured S3 buckets were a goldmine for cybercriminals, making millions of people across North America vulnerable to various forms of attack and fraud, says the report. 

The first bucket was picked up by the team's web scanning tools in January. At the time, they were undertaking numerous investigations into other data leaks and had to complete these before they could analyze Key Ring’s S3 buckets.

Once the details of the leak were confirmed, the vpnMentor team immediately contacted Key Ring and AWS to disclose the discovery and assist in fixing the leak. The buckets were secured shortly after.

Date discovered: January 2020
Date Key Ring and AWS contacted: 18th February 2020
Date of Action: 20th February 2020
Example of Entries in the Unsecured S3 Bucket
Anybody with a web browser could have viewed over 44 million images uploaded by Key Ring users. The private personal user data included scans of:

Government IDs
Retail club membership and loyalty cards
NRA membership cards
Gift cards
Credit cards with all details exposed, incl. CVV numbers
Medical insurance cards
Medical marijuana ID cards
Many more
Key Ring also works as a marketing platform for many of North America’s most prominent retail brands.  As such, the bucket also contained CSV files detailing membership lists and reports for many of these businesses. These lists contained the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data of millions of people.

Examples of companies affected, and the number of customer entries included:

Walmart/Kleenex list: ~16,000,000
Kids Eat Free Campaign: ~64,000
Unknown marketing campaign report: ~86,000
La Madeleine Bakery chain: ~6,600
Footlocker: Unknown amount of records
Mattel ~2,000
In the following example from La Madeleine Bakery, numerous PII data were exposed. This list is similar to many the research team viewed:

Full names
Email addresses
Membership ID numbers
Dates of birth
Locations and Zip Codes
Additional S3 Buckets Discovered
While investigating Key Ring’s first S3 bucket, the research team discovered four more buckets holding even more private data. In these buckets, they found a snapshot of the company’s database, which includes highly sensitive information about its users. Although the snapshot is not new, it held millions of records that were never meant to be exposed, such as: 

User emails
Home addresses
Device and IP address information
Encrypted passwords and the “salt” randomized data used to encrypt them
Data Breach Impact
Two aspects of this leak made it especially dangerous, says the report. 

The sheer volume of files exposed, impacting millions of people across North America
The value of the exposed data to criminal hackers
Aside from the CSV files, over 44 million images of personal cards were uploaded to the database by Key Ring users. These uploads exposed their credit card details, social security numbers, and much more. Had malicious hackers discovered these buckets, the impact on Key Ring users (and the company itself) would be enormous, adds the report. 

""In fact, we can’t say for certain that nobody else found these S3 buckets and downloaded the content before we notified Key Ring. If this happened, simply deleting the exposed data and securing the S3 buckets might not be enough. Hackers would still have access to all the data, stored locally, offline, and completely untraceable,"" concludes the team.

According to cybersecurity expert Mitch@_g0dmode, Zoom’s video conferencing software for Windows is vulnerable to “UNC path injection” flaw that could let hackers steal Windows passwords and execute arbitrary commands on their devices, The Hacker News reported.

The researcher stated that these kinds of attacks are possible because Zoom for Windows software supports remote UNC paths that convert insecure URIs into hyperlinks when received via chat messages. Zoom is a cloud-based enterprise communication platform with over 74,000 customers and 13 million active users. It offers chat, audio, video conferencing, and options to host webinars and virtual meetings online.

How Does the Bug Work?

The existence of the vulnerability is also confirmed by security researchers Matthew Hickey and Mohamed Baset, who stated that attackers exploit the process where Windows inevitably exposes a user’s login username and NTLM password hashes to a remote SMB server while downloading a file hosted on it. In order to steal passwords, the attacker needs to send a crafted URL (i.e., \\x.x.x.x\abc_file) to a victim via a chat interface. Once the user clicks the URL, it eventually allows the attacker-controlled SMB share to capture the verification data from Windows, without the user knowledge.

 Zoom Fixes the Bug

Soon after the vulnerability was identified, the company fixed the issue by releasing a patch. The CEO of Zoom, Eric Yuan, addressed the security issues and stated that a patch has been released to fix the UNC vulnerability. The fix will be pushed out automatically to all the users.

In a blog post, Yuan said, “We recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s – and our own – privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry, and I want to share what we are doing about it. For the past several weeks, supporting this influx of users has been a tremendous undertaking and our sole focus. We have strived to provide you with uninterrupted service and the same user-friendly experience that has made Zoom the video-conferencing platform of choice for enterprises around the world, while also ensuring platform safety, privacy, and security.”

FBI Slams Zoom

Recently, the FBI slammed Zoom for not maintaining proper privacy and security measures for its users. The authorities also warned that the video meeting app is prone to hacking, as it has certain unpatched bugs.

Cybercriminals Target Zoom Domains to Distribute Malware

With majority of the employees working remotely, online communication platforms like Zoom saw a sudden increase in their popularity.  According to a report from Check Point, hackers are taking advantage of the rise in Zoom usage by registering fake and malicious Zoom domains. The report stated that around 1,700 new Zoom domains have been registered since the pandemic, with 25% of the domains registered in the past seven days alone.", ,,,,,,,,,5:20-cv-03670-SVK | 5:20-cv-03252-LHK | 3:20-cv-02353-JD,Zoom Video Communications Inc,Victor M Rios,,121.93000030517578,138.55999755859378,208.0800018310547,261.739990234375,268.0,423.55999755859375,482.2300109863281,453.0,412.8599853515625,337.32000732421875,391.8399963378906,372.7900085449219,326.2300109863281,144.0,136.07142857142858

Escrow.com helps people safely broker all sorts of transactions online (ironically enough, brokering domain sales is a big part of its business). For about two hours starting around 5 p.m. PT Monday evening, Escrow.com’s website looked radically different: Its homepage was replaced with a crude message in plain text:

DomainInvesting.com’s Elliot Silver picked up on the change and got a statement from Matt Barrie, the CEO of freelancer.com, which owns escrow.com.

“During the incident, the hackers changed the DNS records for Escrow.com to point to to a third party web server,” Barrie wrote, noting that his security team managed to talk to the hacker responsible for the hijack via telephone.

Barrie said escrow.com would be sharing more details about the incident in the coming days, but he emphasized that no escrow.com systems were compromised, and no customer data, funds or domains were compromised.

KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Barrie and escrow.com with some follow-up questions, and immediately after that pinged Chris Ueland, CEO of SecurityTrails, a company that helps customers keep track of their digital assets.

Ueland said after hearing about the escrow.com hack Monday evening he pulled the domain name system (DNS) records for escrow.com and saw they were pointing to an Internet address in Malaysia — 111.90.149[.]49 (that address is hobbled here because it is currently flagged as hosting a phishing site). The attacker also obtained free encryption certificates for escrow.com from Let’s Encrypt.

Running a reverse DNS lookup on this 111.90.149[.]49 address shows it is tied to fewer than a dozen domains, including a 12-day-old domain that invokes the name of escrow.com’s registrar — servicenow-godaddy[.]com. Sure enough, loading that domain in a browser reveals the same text that appeared Monday night on escrow.com, minus the redaction above.


The message at servicenow-godaddy[.]com was identical to the one displayed by escrow.com while the site’s DNS records were hacked.

It was starting to look like someone had gotten phished. Then I heard back from Matt Barrie, who said it wasn’t anyone at escrow.com that got phished. Barrie said the hacker was able to read messages and notes left on escrow.com’s account at GoDaddy that only GoDaddy employees should have been able to see.
Barrie said one of those notes stated that certain key changes for escrow.com could only be made after calling a specific phone number and receiving verbal authorization. As it happened, the attacker went ahead and called that number, evidently assuming he was calling someone at GoDaddy.

In fact, the name and number belonged to escrow.com’s general manager, who played along for more than an hour talking to the attacker while recording the call and coaxing information out of him.

“This guy had access to the notes, and knew the number to call,” to make changes to the account, Barrie said. “He was literally reading off the tickets to the notes of the admin panel inside GoDaddy.”

In a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, GoDaddy acknowledged that on March 30 the company was alerted to a security incident involving a customer’s domain name. An investigation revealed a GoDaddy employee had fallen victim to a spear-phishing attack, and that five other customer accounts were “potentially” affected — although GoDaddy wouldn’t say which or how many domains those customer accounts may have with GoDaddy.

“Our team investigated and found an internal employee account triggered the change,” the statement reads. “We conducted a thorough audit on that employee account and confirmed there were five other customer accounts potentially impacted.”

The statement continues:

“We immediately locked down the impacted accounts involved in this incident to prevent further changes. Any actions done by the threat actor have been reverted and the impacted customers have been notified. The employee involved in this incident fell victim to a spear-phishing or social engineering attack. We have taken steps across our technology, processes and employee education, to help prevent these types of attacks in the future.”

There are many things domain owners can and should do to minimize the chances that domain thieves can wrest control over a business-critical domain, but much of that matters little if and when someone at your domain name registrar gets phished or hacked.

But increasingly, savvy attackers are focusing their attention on targeting people at domain registrars and their support personnel. In January, KrebsOnSecurity told the harrowing story of e-hawk.net, an online fraud prevention and scoring service that had its domain name fraudulently transferred to another provider after someone social engineered a customer service representative at e-hawk’s registrar.

Nation-state level attackers also are taking a similar approach. A massive cyber espionage campaign targeting a slew of domains for government agencies across the Middle East region between 2018 and 2019 was preceded by a series of targeted attacks on domain registrars and Internet infrastructure firms that served those countries.

While there is very little you can do to prevent your domain registrar from getting phished or tricked by scammers, there are several precautions that you can control. For maximum security on your domains, consider adopting some or all of the following best practices:

-Use 2-factor authentication, and require it to be used by all relevant users and subcontractors.

-In cases where passwords are used, pick unique passwords and consider password managers.

-Review the security of existing accounts with registrars and other providers, and make sure you have multiple notifications in place when and if a domain you own is about to expire.

-Use registration features like Registry Lock that can help protect domain name records from being changed. Note that this may increase the amount of time it takes going forward to make key changes to the locked domain (such as DNS changes).

-Use DNSSEC (both signing zones and validating responses).

-Use access control lists for applications, Internet traffic and monitoring.

-Monitor the issuance of new SSL certificates for your domains by monitoring, for example, Certificate Transparency Logs.

The “incident involving a property system” is believed to have come from an application at a franchise property which helps provides services to guests.
The hotel group says that it identified that “an unexpected amount of guest information” may have been accessed using the login credentials of two employees from mid-January to the end of February.
Marriott believes that the following information could have been attained:
Contact details
Loyalty account information (but not passwords)
Additional personal details, such as company, gender and date of birth
Partnerships and affiliations e.g. linked airline loyalty programmes
Preferences e.g. room/stay and language preference
Marriott disabled the login credentials upon discovery of the activity and says it is carrying out an investigation into the matter. The company has also “implemented heightened monitoring and notified relevant authorities”.
In a statement published today, the group said:
“Although Marriott’s investigation is ongoing, the company currently has no reason to believe that the information involved included Marriott Bonvoy account passwords or PINs, payment card information, national IDs, or driver’s license numbers.”
In addition, if the group has determined that a Marriott Bonvoy member’s information was involved, it has disabled the existing password and prompted the guest to enable multi-factor authentication to further protect access to their account.
Marriott has also set up a dedicated website along with call centre resources to provide additional information to guests. The website and email will outline a list of steps guests involved can consider taking. Guests can also consider enrolling in a personal information monitoring service free of charge for one year.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048286/000162828021002433/0001628280-21-002433-index.htm,2021-02-18 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,76.16000366210938,90.94000244140624,88.5,85.7300033569336,85.51000213623047,102.91000366210938,92.58000183105469,92.87999725341795,126.87000274658205,130.47000122070312,116.30999755859376,148.47000122070312,148.22999572753906,88.5,93.08333333333331

The insurance giant told TechCrunch it was investigating a “security incident” involving the unauthorized access to data belonging to an unnamed third-party. Chubb spokesperson Jeffrey Zack said the company had “no evidence” the incident affected Chubb’s own network and that its network “remains fully operational.”
But the spokesperson declined to comment further or answer any of our questions, including if its customers were affected.
Brett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft, first alerted TechCrunch to the breach on Thursday. According to Callow, the security incident was a data-stealing ransomware attack launched by the Maze ransomware group. Maze not only spreads across a network, infecting and encrypting every computer in its path, it also exfiltrates the data to the attackers’ servers where it is held for ransom. If a ransom isn’t paid, the attackers publish the files online.
In December, the FBI privately warned businesses of an increase in Maze-related ransomware incidents.
Callow said the attackers behind the incident posted a listing on their website claiming to have data stolen from Chubb in earlier in March.

“GE and Canon haven’t disclosed how the breach occurred but what has been released seems to indicate that it likely was accomplished using a standard credential phishing attack or due to credential reuse on another site,” Grimes said.
                              .
Direct deposit forms, driver’s licenses, birth certificates, passports, marriage certificates, medical child support orders, tax withholding forms applications for benefits such as retirement or severance were among the documents tapped between February 3 to February 14 after “an unauthorized third party gained access to an email account that contained documents of certain GE employees, former employees and beneficiaries entitled to benefits that were maintained on Canon’s systems,” GE said in an alert.
The documents were uploaded by or for those affected and may have contained Social Security numbers, banks account numbers, birthdates, names, addresses and drivers’ licenses among other information contained in relevant forms.
The unique types of information potentially leaves the involved victims in a higher risk position than most stolen confidential information,” said Grimes.
Data in child support orders “could lead an attacker to create a spear phishing email crafted with those specific details, pretending to be someone official claiming some impending event needs action right now or some unwelcome especially stressful event could occur,” he said, while “knowledge of death certificates could help an attacker craft new synthetic identities based on details of that involved person to get new credit cards, loans, and other financial instruments.”", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.21999931335449,19.6299991607666,19.8700008392334,21.40999984741211,19.790000915527344,17.299999237060547,16.209999084472653,16.450000762939453,18.690000534057614,19.559999465942386,21.170000076293945,22.030000686645508,22.1200008392334,0.2515,3.5283333333333338

The company’s security director Luo Shiyao responded to Wei's post, hinting that the phone numbers were leaked in a brute force attack while other details can easily be collected online - however even this post was later deleted from Weibo.
Experts who are following the issue closely suggest that there are irregularities in the statement issued by Weibo. While the company has stated that the data was extracted using an API, experts suggest that the data on sale includes details which are normally not shared using APIs.

Information from a database belonging to Norwegian Cruise Line was discovered on the dark web by an intelligence team at DynaRisk on March 13. 
Data exposed in the incident included clear text passwords and email addresses used to log in to the Norwegian Cruise Line travel agent portal by agents working for companies including Virgin Holidays and TUI. 
DynaRisk said data relating to 29,969 travel agents was breached from the portal on the agents.ncl.eu website on March 12.
""After verifying that the data records are legitimate credentials, we notified a Norwegian Cruise Line representative immediately. Despite opening our message later that day, we received no response. After five days a representative responded to our team to discuss the breach,"" said a DynaRisk spokesperson.
DynaRisk said that the incident left agents who were ""already vulnerable at this time"" at higher risk of cybercrime. 
A DynaRisk spokesperson said: ""They are now exposed to account takeovers on numerous platforms, sophisticated phishing emails and fraud, which could put further pressure on large travel agents or worse still, put smaller agents out of business.""
Norwegian Cruise Lines told Infosecurity Magazine: “It has recently come to our attention that the agents.ncl.eu website may have been compromised. In an abundance of caution, we are in the process of asking certain travel partners that may have been affected to change their password for the site and any site for which they may have used the same password, and to remain vigilant of any suspicious activity or emails. 
""We believe limited personal information was involved, specifically names of travel agencies and business contact information such as business addresses and email.

What happened?
On February 26, 2020, Rogers became aware that one of our external service providers had inadvertently made information available online that provided access to a database managed by that service provider. We immediately made sure the information was removed and began an investigation to see how many customers might have been impacted. No credit card, no banking, or no password information was exposed. We are directly contacting any customer whose information was in the database. We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience this may cause.

2. How do I know if I was impacted?
Rogers is directly contacting all customers whose information is included in the database via email. If we don’t have an email address on file for you, you will receive a letter.

3. What information was visible?
Customer information that was used by the service provider to fulfill promotional offers on behalf of Rogers was included in the vendor database. This was limited to customer name, address, account number, email address and telephone number. No credit card, no banking, or no password information was exposed.

4. How do I know my account information is safe?
Rogers customer databases remain secure and were not impacted by this incident. We are committed to protecting our customers’ personal information and acted quickly to secure customer information. We have rigorous policies and procedures in place to fully comply with all Canadian privacy laws and regulations, and act promptly if an issue arises.

5. What have you done to ensure this doesn’t happen again? 
We take the protection of our customer’s private information seriously, and regret what occurred. We immediately made sure customer information was secured. We require our vendors to use best-in-class privacy and security measures to protect customer information. Best practices are constantly evolving, and we will continue to review our policies and procedures and update if necessary.



6. What are you doing to protect impacted customers?
Securing impacted customers’ accounts is the most important action a company can take during a privacy incident and we immediately took steps to do so. As a precaution, we’re taking extra steps to protect affected customers. This includes: 
• notifying impacted customers directly
• offering a complimentary credit monitoring service through TransUnion that provides credit monitoring and alerts, and fraud identity insurance. Customers who are affected will receive details in the email or letter we send them. 
• adding extra authentication procedures to impacted accounts. When those customers call us to discuss their account, they will be asked for additional information to verify their identity. This is information that’s easy for the customer to provide and would only be known by them

Some wireless account numbers were included in the vendor database. If a customer’s wireless account number was included, we added a block to their account (called port protection) to prevent their phone number from being transferred to another carrier without their authorization. Customers can call us if they wish to remove this block.

Customers can also add additional security measures to their account, such as adding a security PIN or registering for the Voice ID program, by contacting us directly.

7. How do sign up for the credit monitoring service?
Impacted customers will receive a notification that includes details of an activation code. If you receive a notification and wish to activate this service, please go to www.mytrueidentity.ca and enter your activation code by June 30, 2020. The service includes:
• Daily access to your credit score on Trans Union’s website, as well as credit report monitoring and alerts of key changes
• Monitoring hidden websites where personal information might be made available to unauthorized users
• Up to $50,000 in fraud identify insurance should your information be compromised. 

8. I didn’t get an email with an activation code number. How do I get a code number?
If you did not receive a notification from us, then you were not impacted by this event. If you have misplaced your activation code, please contact our customer service team for further assistance.

9. What can I do to protect myself?
In addition to the security measures taken by Rogers, customers are encouraged to adopt good habits to ensure their personal information remains secure. For example: 
• change your passwords and security questions frequently;
• review all your service and financial accounts for any suspicious activity; 
• never click links or open attachments in unsolicited emails and text messages;
• use secure WiFi connections when making online purchases or checking bank accounts;

Koodo is mostly oriented toward younger customers and differs from its parent Telus by not requiring a fixed term contract. Koodo currently provides postpaid, prepaid, and wireless home phone services. 

According to a data breach notification email from Koodo Mobile that was seen by BleepingComputer, their systems were hacked on February 13th, 2020, and an unauthorized person stole customer data from August and September 2017 that contains mobile account numbers and telephone numbers.

""What happened: On February 13, 2020, an unauthorized third party using compromised credentials accessed our systems and copied August/September 2017 data that included your mobility account number and telephone number. It is possible that the information exposed has changed since 2017, in which case your current information is not compromised,"" the email stated.

According to BleepingComputer, this information can be used by scammers to port Koodo Mobile numbers to attacker's devices to receive two-factor authentication codes, which could allow attackers to gain access to email and bank accounts. To prevent this, Koodo has enabled the 'Port Protection' feature on the affected accounts, which prevents attackers from porting a Koodo Mobile number to another carrier unless the account holder first calls and requests it to be done, says the news report. 

""We have found evidence that the unauthorized third party is offering the information for sale on the dark web,"" continued the email. ""With port protection in place, we do not believe that your information could be used for any fraudulent purposes. Nevertheless, we have reported this incident to Law Enforcement and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and we are working closely with them on this matter,"" the Koodo notification warned.

However, BleepingComputer notes that they then contradict themselves later in the notification by saying that affected users should not use their mobile number for two-factor authentication due to this data breach.", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.529999732971193,16.229999542236328,16.219999313354492,17.09000015258789,17.569999694824222,18.229999542236328,18.15999984741211,18.200000762939453,18.950000762939453,19.959999084472656,20.84000015258789,20.729999542236328,20.93000030517578,16.45,18.753125

What Happened?
In September 2019, Entercom experienced a cyber-attack. We immediately began an investigation with

unauthorized actor accessed information relating to Radio.com users contained in database backup files. After a
thorough and intensive review process, the investigation recently confirmed the population of impacted
individuals whose protected personal information was accessed by the unauthorized actor.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of your personal information are among our highest priorities. We have
taken and continue to take steps to prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, including by

Dear Customer,
We want to let you know about a sophisticated attack that we recently identified and quickly shut down, which may have impacted some of your account information.
Our Cybersecurity team recently identified and shut down a malicious attack against our email vendor that led to unauthorized access to certain T-Mobile employee email accounts, some of which contained account information for T-Mobile customers and employees. An investigation was immediately commenced, with assistance from leading cybersecurity forensics experts, to determine what happened and what information was affected. We immediately reported this matter to federal law enforcement and are actively cooperating in their investigation.
The information accessed may have included customer names and addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, rate plans and features, and billing information. Your financial information (including credit card information) and Social Security number were not impacted.
We are not aware of any evidence where the information contained in the affected email accounts has been used to commit fraud or otherwise misused.
We regret that this incident occurred. We take the security of your information very seriously and while we have a number of safeguards in place to protect customer information from unauthorized access, we are also always working to further enhance security so we can stay ahead of this type of activity.

We recently learned of unauthorized disclosure of one or more of your secure messages within the
Walgreens mobile app. We are contacting you to provide you with information about the incident and also
with information about steps you can take to protect yourself.

WHAT HAPPENED
On January 15, 2020, Walgreens discovered an error within the Walgreens mobile app personal secure
messaging feature. Our investigation determined that an internal application error allowed certain personal
messages from Walgreens that are stored in a database to be viewable by other customers using the
Walgreens mobile app. Once we learned of the incident, Walgreens promptly took steps to temporarily
disable message viewing to prevent further disclosure and then implemented a technical correction that
resolved the issue.

As part of our investigation, Walgreens determined that certain messages containing limited health-related
information were involved in this incident for a small percentage of impacted customers. We believe that
you were part of the impacted customer group and that one or more personal messages containing your
limited health-related information may have been viewed by another customer on the Walgreens mobile
app between January 9, 2020 and January 15, 2020.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED
Our investigation determined the following information might have been viewed by another customer:
• First and last name
• Prescription number and drug name
• Store number
• Shipping address where applicable
No financial information such as Social Security number or bank account information was involved in this
incident.
WHAT ARE WE DOING
Walgreens promptly took steps to disable the message viewing feature within the Walgreens mobile app to
prevent further disclosure until a permanent correction was implemented to resolve the issue. Walgreens

MGM did not disclose the number of customers affected, but Under the Breach, a firm that monitors cybercrimes and provides intelligence about potential data breaches to companies, said 10.6 million people were affected.

Under the Breach said several high-profile guests at MGM properties had their email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses exposed, including one guest with the same name as Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive.

Twitter declined to comment on Wednesday night.

MGM Resorts said the vast majority of those affected had “phone book information” breached such as name, phone number and address. About 1,300 individuals had more sensitive data — from their driver’s licenses, passports or military ID cards — exposed, MGM said.

“Last summer, we discovered unauthorized access to a cloud server that contained a limited amount of information for certain previous guests of MGM Resorts,” MGM Resorts International said in a statement. “We are confident that no financial, payment card or password data was involved in this matter.”

MGM Resorts said it had promptly notified guests potentially affected by the breach in accordance with state laws. MGM did not disclose who had breached the data, but said it had worked with law enforcement to investigate. The company also hired two cybersecurity firms to investigate, review and help fix the breach.

“At MGM Resorts, we take our responsibility to protect guest data very seriously, and we have strengthened and enhanced the security of our network to prevent this from happening again,” the company said.

MGM Resorts publicly acknowledged the breach after ZDNet, a technology news website, published a report on Wednesday detailing how the personal information of guests had been posted on a hacking forum.

The MGM breach followed a spate of attacks on the American hospitality industry, which included the hack of the Marriott hotel chain in 2018. That breach compromised data on roughly 500 million hotel guests.

Upon further review I was able to see connections to New York based cosmetic company Estée Lauder. I could see audit logs that contained a large number of email addresses in each document. I immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice Estée Lauder alerting them to the exposure.

As in most large companies when reporting a data exposure it is usually extremely difficult to get through the firewall of gate-keepes, but several hours later and multiple emails the data was still exposed. After calling every phone number I could find I was able to reach someone by phone who then promised to pass on the information. The company acted fast and professionally and restricted public access to the database on the same day as my notification.

This company has been a household name for over 70 years and had an annual revenue of $14.863B in 2019 it seems logical that there would be a large dataset associated with the business. According to Wikipedia “ESTĒE LAUDER is an American multinational manufacturer and marketer of prestige skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels”. I can only speculate or assume that the email addresses were from digital commerce or online sales.

Here is what we discovered:

440,336,852 logs and records that should not have been publicly exposed online.
 “User” emails in plain text (including internal email addresses from the @estee.com domain)
Production, Audit, Error, CMS, and Middleware logs were exposed.
References to reports and other internal documents.
IP addresses, Ports, Pathways, and storage info that cyber criminals could exploit to access deeper into the network.
There were millions of records pertaining to middleware that is used by the Estée Lauder company. Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what’s offered by the operating system. Data management, application services, messaging, authentication, and API management are all commonly handled by middleware. Another danger of this exposure is the fact that middleware can create a secondary path for malware, through which applications and data can be compromised. In this instance anyone with an internet connection could see what versions or builds are being used, the paths, and other information that could serve as a backdoor into the network.

 





In 2011 databreaches.net reported Estée Lauder sent a notice regarding the theft of a company-issued laptop that contained names and Social Security Numbers of current and former employees and contractors for the firm. In the internal memo it appears the company requested users to change their passwords and use encryption.

To the best of my knowledge the database did not contain payment data or sensitive employee information based on what I personally saw. I reported my findings as soon as I made an assumption of who owned the data and did not have the time to validate 440 million records before public access was closed. With the understanding that every second counts when it comes to the risks of a data exposure our top priority was alerting Estée Lauder.

It is unclear exactly how many “user” email addresses were exposed. It is also unclear how long the Estée Lauder database was exposed or who else may have accessed the records. As security researchers our primary goal is data protection and when we see consumer data of any kind the first priority is to alert the owner to take immediate action. Our mission is to highlight data protection and raise awareness that companies and organizations must do more to protect the data they collect and store. We follow a responsible disclosure process and securely delete any screenshots or information taken for verification purposes. Estée Lauder did not provide a statement for this story but was responsive in communicating that they had received the notice, thanked us for alerting them, and had completed their internal investigation.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,
Altice USA takes seriously our commitment to protecting your personal information. Unfortunately, we are contacting
you about an email phishing incident that may have involved some of your personal information. We regret this incident
occurred and apologize for any inconvenience or concern it may cause you. While we have no information at this
time that would indicate that your personal information has been misused, below please find details about the incident,
information about the complimentary identity and credit monitoring resources we are providing, and additional steps you
can take to protect your information.
What happened?
In November 2019, an unauthorized third party gained access to certain Altice USA employees’ email account credentials
through a phishing incident. The unauthorized third party then used the stolen credentials to remotely access and, in
some instances, download the employees’ mailbox contents. Upon identifying this incident through our internal controls,
we secured the email accounts, engaged an expert computer forensics firm to assist with our investigation, and notified
law enforcement.
What information was involved?
During our investigation, we learned in January 2020 that one of the downloaded mailboxes contained a password
protected report that contained personal information, including name, Social Security number and address for a limited
number of customers. Your information was included in this report.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1702780/000162828021001975/0001628280-21-001975-index.htm,2021-02-12 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1702780/000162828020001613/0001628280-20-001613-index.htm,MDA,2020-02-14 00:00:00,"For example, in November 2019, a phishing attack against employee email accounts resulted in the exposure of certain employees' email credentials and, as a result, the exposure of information in those accounts including personal information of current and former employees as well as some customers. We took measures to secure against these attacks and responded by notifying affected persons, relevant state and federal agencies and law enforcement agencies. While the November 2019 attack appears to be contained both from an exposure and cost perspective, we have learned of at least one putative class action having been filed on February 13, 2020, and this and similar attacks could impose costs, liability and reputational harm that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.",0,,,,,,,27.790000915527344,26.440000534057607,23.20000076293945,23.53000068664551,25.8700008392334,24.239999771118164,28.020000457763672,26.649999618530273,26.809999465942386,29.3700008392334,34.709999084472656,36.810001373291016,36.86999893188477,35.0,35.42857142857143

The Google Takeout service allows users to download content that has been uploaded to various services operated by Google.


 
This includes the content and data that has been uploaded to Google Photos, YouTube, Chrome, and many other services.

When users downloaded their data using Google Takeout, this bug would have caused other people's videos to also be included in their Google Photos data archive.

For those who received another user's private video, Google recommends that you just delete it.

""The underlying issues has been identified and resolved. We recommend you perform another export of your content and delete your prior export at this time,"" the Google notification stated.

As you can imagine, for those who are affected, this is a serious privacy lapse as users expect their photos and videos to remain private and not be shared with any others.

This bug also illustrates the inherent risks of storing your data in the cloud.

MSRC / By MSRC Team / January 22, 2020 / Misconfiguration, Privacy
Today, we concluded an investigation into a misconfiguration of an internal customer support database used for Microsoft support case analytics. While the investigation found no malicious use, and although most customers did not have personally identifiable information exposed, we want to be transparent about this incident with all customers and reassure them that we are taking it very seriously and holding ourselves accountable.

Our investigation has determined that a change made to the database’s network security group on December 5, 2019 contained misconfigured security rules that enabled exposure of the data. Upon notification of the issue, engineers remediated the configuration on December 31, 2019 to restrict the database and prevent unauthorized access. This issue was specific to an internal database used for support case analytics and does not represent an exposure of our commercial cloud services.

As part of Microsoft’s standard operating procedures, data stored in the support case analytics database is redacted using automated tools to remove personal information. Our investigation confirmed that the vast majority of records were cleared of personal information in accordance with our standard practices. In some scenarios, the data may have remained unredacted if it met specific conditions. An example of this occurs if the information is in a non-standard format, such as an email address separated with spaces instead of written in a standard format (for example, “XYZ @contoso com” vs “XYZ@contoso.com”). We have begun notifications to customers whose data was present in this redacted database. 

We are committed to the privacy and security of our customers and are taking action to prevent future occurrences of this issue. These actions include:

Auditing the established network security rules for internal resources. 
Expanding the scope of the mechanisms that detect security rule misconfigurations.  
Adding additional alerting to service teams when security rule misconfigurations are detected. 
Implementing additional redaction automation.  
Misconfigurations are unfortunately a common error across the industry. We have solutions to help prevent this kind of mistake, but unfortunately, they were not enabled for this database. As we’ve learned, it is good to periodically review your own configurations and ensure you are taking advantage of all protections available. 

This documentation is included as general guidance and is not all inclusive or a single source of truth for how to configure your environment.

November 15, 2019, after extensive review of the email contents, the investigation determined that
personal information of one Maryland resident was potentially accessible, including the
individual’s name and Social Security number.
On December 31, 2019, Ollie’s will mail written notifications to the potentially affected
Maryland resident in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-3504 in substantially the
same form as the enclosed letter. Ollie’s is offering the individual complimentary membership in
credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian. Ollie’s is also providing

Avid Technology is writing to inform you of an event that may impact some of your personal information. We wanted
to provide you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the
possibility of fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.
What Happened? In October of last year, Avid determined there had been unauthorized access to certain Avid
employee email accounts. Avid first identified suspicious activity within an email account on September 24, 2018,
and promptly launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident, the information that may have
been improperly accessed, and the identities of the impacted individuals. Avid also took steps to secure the email
accounts. The investigation determined a rule to forward all incoming messages to an unauthorized email account
was established on an employee’s account from October 8, 2018 to October 12, 2018. Avid then began an extensive
programmatic and manual review of the impacted account to determine if any sensitive data was contained in the
account. Avid began notifying individuals on or around June 5, 2019, while this data review was underway. On August
16, 2019, we completed the process of identifying individuals who may have had personal information accessible in
the account. We recently concluded a thorough, manual review of our records to identify contact information for the
remaining individuals with information accessible within the account.

The vulnerability within Twitter for Android could allow the bad actor to see non-public account information or to control your account (send Tweets or Direct Messages), said an apologetic Twitter.

“Prior to the fix, through a complicated process involving the insertion of malicious code into restricted storage areas of the Twitter app, it may have been possible for a bad actor to access information (Direct Messages, protected Tweets, location information) from the app,” Twitter said in a statement.

The company said it does not have direct evidence that malicious code was inserted into the app or that this vulnerability was exploited, but it can’t be completely sure. Twitter did not divulge the number of users affected too.


“We have taken steps to fix this issue and are directly notifying people who could have been exposed to this vulnerability either through the Twitter app or by email with specific instructions to keep them safe”.

Twitter recommended updating to the latest version for Android as the issue did not impact “Twitter for iOS”.

“We’re sorry this happened and will continue working to keep your information secure on Twitter,” said the company in the email sent to the Indian users, adding that those affected can also reach out to Twitter’s Office of Data Protection, requesting information regarding their account security.


The new data breach in Twitter was reported two days after several Indian users saw warning pop-ups from Google on their mobile and desktop screens as they opened certain affected websites in the Google Chrome browser, alerting them about a data breach on the site or app they had visited which also exposed their passwords.

The Internet giant issued warning of data breach for users in India and globally after fixing the Chrome 79 bug and re-issuing it for the public.

“Change your password. A data breach on a site or app exposed your password. Chrome recommends changing your password for the site,” read the warning pop-up.


Twitter has faced several vulnerabilities on its platform in the recent past.

In May, Twitter disclosed a bug that shared some iOS users’ data with an unnamed partner, even if the users did not opt to share data. The bug affected Twitter’s iOS user base and they were notified about the issue.

In February, a bug in Twitter exposed private tweets of some Android users for over five years when they made changes in their settings, like changing the email address linked to their accounts.


The vulnerability disabled the “Protect your Tweets” setting if certain account changes were made on Android devices.

In a mega data breach last year, the micro-blogging platform alerted all users to change their password after it discovered a bug that stored passwords in plain text in an internal system.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password,” said Parag Agrawal, Chief Technology Officer at Twitter.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,32.130001068115234,34.09000015258789,39.04999923706055,23.95000076293945,27.01000022888184,32.22999954223633,33.40999984741211,37.060001373291016,38.959999084472656,39.900001525878906,46.349998474121094,44.68000030517578,54.63999938964844,35.0,33.5

An estimated 1 million records* in the database contained information about Honda owners and their vehicles.  No password or other authentication was needed to access the records, which included names, contact details, and vehicle information.

*Please note that I was unable to confirm the exact number of unique customer records, this number is based on cluster statistics and keywords search analysis. In its statement (see below) Honda estimates this number to be around 26,000.

Elasticsearch cluster appeared to be data logging and monitoring server for telematics services for Honda North America covering the process for new customer enrollment.

I have immediately notified Honda; company acted promptly and secured the server within hours after initial notification. Honda provided me with the following statement:

Thank you very much for pointing out the database vulnerability. The security of our customers’ data is of vital importance to us, and we continually review our processes to ensure that their data is protected. The security issue you identified could have potentially allowed outside parties to access some of our customers’ personal information. We quickly investigated this issue, determined the specific breach in protocol, and took immediate steps to address the vulnerability. All data in this database is now secure.

The database in question is a data logging and monitoring server for telematics services for North America covering the process for new customer enrollment as well as internal logs.  As of today, Honda estimates the number of unique consumer related records in this database to be around 26,000. We are basing this number on a detailed review of the databases on this server, eliminating duplicate information and eliminating the data that does not contain consumer PII.  We can also say with certainty that there was no financial, credit card or password information exposed on this database. The server on which the database resides was misconfigured on October 21, 2019.

Honda is continuing to perform due diligence, and if it is determined that data was compromised, we will take appropriate actions in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. We will continue to work on proactive security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

We appreciate your efforts to raise awareness of cyber security issues.

The records appear to have been exposed for over a week, which would have allowed malicious parties ample time to copy the data for their own purposes if they found it.

Here’s the timeline:
– December 4 – The database was first indexed by search engine BinaryEdge.
– December 11 – I have discovered the database and began investigating.
– December 12 – I have alerted Honda’s security team in Japan.
– December 13 – The server was shut down.

We don’t know if any other unauthorized parties accessed the database while it was not secured.

What information was exposed?
The database contained identifying information of  Honda owners and their vehicles:

– Full name
– Email address
– Phone number
– Mailing address
– Vehicle make and model
– Vehicle VIN number
– Agreement ID
– Other service information

The server also contained some internal logs and maintenance records.

Dangers of exposed data
The information in this database could be valuable to criminals if they managed to find it before the server was shut down. It is best to assume the worst and take steps to protect yourself if you think you might be impacted.

In particular, the personal details of Honda drivers could be used in targeted phishing campaigns. Affected customers should be on the lookout for emails and other messages from scammers posing as Honda or a related company.

Phishing messages often impersonate trusted people or organizations to trick victims into giving up sensitive information or money. They often contain links to phishing websites, which mimic genuine websites. In fact, they exist only to steal information, such as passwords and payment information.

Honda’s previous data security incidents
Honda has suffered two major data leaks in the past.

The first in late 2010 shared many similarities with the latest exposure. Hackers breached a database of Honda and Acura owners in the US. 2.2 million Honda customers who had registered for an Owner Link account had their names, usernames, email addresses, and VIN numbers exposed. Acura drivers only had their email addresses exposed.

Earlier this year, Honda leaked 40GB of employee data, or about 134 million rows of information. Again, the database was left exposed without any authentication required to access it. Instead of user data, however, this database contained information about Honda’s security systems and networks, such as IP addresses, operating systems, and update logs. Analysts feared it would allow attackers to launch further attacks against the company.

How and why we discovered this leak
Our goal is to help to protect data on the Internet by identifying data leaks and following responsible disclosure policies. Our mission is to make the cyber world safer by educating businesses and communities worldwide.

Our extensive cybersecurity knowledge lends itself well to searching for and analyzing data leaks. Our due diligence demands that we make every attempt to identify who is responsible and notify them as quickly as possible.

Our hope is to minimize harm to end users whose data was exposed. We take steps to find out what each database contained, for how long it was exposed, and what threats to end users might arise as a result. Our findings are compiled into reports like this one to raise awareness and curb misuse of personal data by malicious parties.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,29.18000030517578,27.78000068664551,27.04999923706055,21.280000686645508,22.6299991607666,23.8700008392334,27.21999931335449,26.229999542236328,25.739999771118164,24.93000030517578,24.239999771118164,29.190000534057607,29.31999969482422,,

by Rooster Teeth on December 11, 2019  Updates
We are saddened to report that on December 2, 2019, the Rooster Teeth online store (https://store.roosterteeth.com/) experienced a data security incident that may have compromised a limited group of customers’ personal information. It is important to note that this did not affect Rooster Teeth accounts or FIRST membership subscriptions as this incident remained isolated to the Shopify platform for the online store – store.roosterteeth.com. We immediately investigated the incident, took steps to prevent incidents like this in the future, and notified potentially impacted customers via email and letter. If we did not send you an email, then you were not one of our potentially affected customers. Our community’s privacy and security is a key concern, and we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this incident has caused. Information about no-cost consumer protection services for potentially affected customers is available below, and in addition our customer care team is available to assist you with any questions or concerns at rtstorecare@roosterteeth.com.

The following form of notice has been sent to potentially impacted customers via email, and, if you reside in the domestic United States, a physical copy has been sent to your most recent mailing address.

Notice of Data Breach

We are writing to notify you of a data security incident involving our e-commerce website, https://store.roosterteeth.com (“Site”).  You are receiving this notice because our records show that you may have been affected by this incident.  Please read this notice carefully, as it provides information about the incident, the steps we have taken to secure our systems, and the resources available to you to protect yourself against the unauthorized use of your personal information.

Our goal is to provide our community with a safe shopping environment, and we apologize for this incident.  Please note that free Rooster Teeth accounts and Rooster Teeth FIRST accounts were not affected by this incident as it remained limited to the Site’s e-commerce platform, which is powered by Shopify.

What Happened?

On December 2, 2019, Rooster Teeth discovered that malicious code had been added to the Site earlier the same day.  The malicious code directed users entering a checkout on the Site to a spoofed webpage where they were asked to enter payment card details in order to complete their purchases.  This was inserted after the stage at which users entered their shipping data.  Users who completed the payment card details page were then directed to the real webpage, where they were asked to complete the forms again.   

We removed the malicious code from the Site and took other steps to secure the Site against further unauthorized access.  The incident did not affect any other part of the Site or other information maintained by us.  It is our goal to provide a safe and secure shopping environment, and we will continue to review, audit, and improve our security controls and processes.

What Information Was Involved?

If you entered information on the spoofed webpage described above, your name, email address, telephone number, physical address, and/or payment card information (including expiration dates and security codes) may have been exposed.  You are receiving this notice because our records show that you visited the affected checkout process on our Site on the day of the incident and may have been affected by this incident.

What We Are Doing to Protect Your Information

To help protect your identity, we are offering third party monitoring services through Experian for one year for those potentially impacted consumers who reside in territories where such services are available. Further details, if applicable, are included in your individual notice. 

What You Can Do

We encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by carefully reviewing your payment card or personal account statements for unauthorized charges and monitoring free credit reports for fraudulent activity or errors resulting from the incident.  If you suspect an unauthorized charge has been placed on your account, we encourage you to report it to your payment card issuer.  According to the payment card brands’ policies, you are not responsible for unauthorized charges to your account if you report them in a timely manner.  For additional information on identity theft or setting up credit alerts or credit freezes, please review the document enclosed with this letter.

The virus was targeted at Windows-based systems and did not attack our global ERP system (SAP) and other non-Windows-based systems.  Critical systems were back online within a few days of the incident. As part of our in-depth investigation into this incident, we engaged outside cyber security experts to assist us with investigation and remediation efforts.

We anticipate some ongoing expenses relating to this incident will continue into the first half of 2020.  

We have insurance coverage for costs resulting from cyberattacks. At this time, we expect that our losses from this incident will exceed our insurance coverage.  We have not recorded any estimated proceeds resulting from an insurance claim regarding this incident since covered expenses as a result of this incident are still not yet quantified and, in any case, disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon.

Choice recently learned of a technical issue that occurred only in a specific circumstance. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice’s website being inadvertently accessible to third parties with whom Choice has a business relationship when the visitor’s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice. 

For visitors to Choice’s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice’s website and sends the data to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information entered by visitors. Choice said it believes this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written.

This specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through Nov. 12, 2019. Choice has identified the guest reservations involved that occurred since April 2016 and has sent emails to those guests. 

“We believe that this scenario occurred very infrequently from June 2015 – March 2016 (likely less than 25 times), but we do not have information available to identify the specific guests so we are issuing a press release and posting this notice to notify those guests,” the company said in a statement.

If a visitor to Choice’s website was using Safari and on the reservation page, the information that had been typed in fields on that page that could have been put in the website address when the browser restarted after a crash may include the name of the person making the reservation, email address, state, zip code, country code, and the number and expiration date of the payment card used to make the reservation.

""We are notifying you because this scenario occurred when you were making a reservation,"" Choice said in a statement. ""If you were making a reservation using a mixture of points and payment, the external verification value on the card may have also been in the website address.""

“As soon as we identified the scenario that caused this on Nov. 12, 2019, Choice made changes to the code that operates our website to override how Safari responds after a crash,” Choice said in a statement. “We are also contacting the third-party companies we work with to ask them to delete any data they may have.”

Earlier this year, someone stole around 700,000 guest records—including names, addresses, emails and phone numbers—belonging to Choice Hotels International, according to Comparitech. The technology website said it collaborated with security researcher Bob Diachenko to uncover the publicly available database.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,97.25,104.8499984741211,100.2300033569336,91.27999877929688,63.81999969482422,74.56999969482422,81.87000274658203,78.4000015258789,84.3499984741211,101.19000244140624,88.31999969482422,84.05000305175781,102.4499969482422,99.0,98.0

Magento Marketplace is an online portal for buying, selling, and downloading themes and plugins for Magento-based online stores.

In a notification sent to its customers, the company stated that a security vulnerability in Magento’s website allowed unknown intruders to access registered users’ account information. It’s unclear when the attackers exploited the vulnerability, but the company’s security team said they discovered the intrusion on November 21, 2019.

The exposed information included usernames, email addresses, store usernames (MageID), billing and shopping addresses, phone number, and limited commercial information. However, the company clarified that account passwords and financial data were not exposed in the incident.

“On November 21, we became aware of a vulnerability related to Magento Marketplace. We temporarily took down the Magento Marketplace in order to address the issue. The Marketplace is back online. This issue did not affect the operation of any Magento core products or services,” the company said in a statement.

“We have notified impacted Magento Marketplace account holders directly. We take these issues seriously and are committed to helping ensure our platforms are secure. We are reviewing our processes to help prevent these types of events from occurring in the future,” the statement added.

In a recent security incident, Adobe mistakenly exposed around 7.5 million user account details. This vulnerability was brought to light by Security Researcher and Consultant Bob Diachenko and reported in the press by Paul Bischoff Tech Journalist, Privacy Advocate and VPN Expert from Comparitech.

As per Adobe’s whitepaper, most components of Creative Cloud are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Elasticsearch database is used to store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in near real-time. Diachenko’s analysis spotted that this Elasticsearch database was left exposed as there was no password protection provided for it.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,309.05999755859375,330.7900085449219,346.8999938964844,337.5199890136719,305.8299865722656,348.5,375.1700134277344,426.9200134277344,437.1000061035156,510.3200073242188,488.510009765625,478.55999755859375,477.0299987792969,350.0,343.38095238095235

What Happened
We recently determined that between October 11 and 22, 2019, a small percentage of local store locations were the victim of
a phishing incident in which an unauthorized person potentially had access to a limited number of local store email accounts.
Immediately upon learning of this, The UPS Store, Inc. initiated an investigation to assess the incident’s scope, including
engaging a third-party cybersecurity firm, and have taken steps to further strengthen and enhance the security of systems in
The UPS Store network, including updating administrative and technical safeguards. As part of the investigation, The UPS
Store, Inc. reviewed the potentially affected accounts, and in early November, found personal information in those accounts.
The personal information was contained in documents that were emailed to The UPS Store location for printing or similar
services provided by those locations. You, or someone you know, may have emailed the document(s) containing personal
information to the local store for this service. We are unaware of any misuse of your personal information in connection with
this incident at this time.

We represent Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (“Wayside”), located in Eatontown, New Jersey.
This letter is being sent pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Comm. Law §§ 14-3501 – 3508 because we
believe the personal information of twenty-two (22) Maryland residents may have been affected by
a recent data security incident. The incident may have involved unauthorized access to residents’
Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver’s license/state identification numbers, financial
account information, medical/health information, and/or username and password.
On June 20, 2019, Wayside discovered unusual activity involving its email system. Upon learning
of this activity, Wayside launched an internal investigation and retained a leading digital forensics
firm to perform an independent investigation to determine what happened, whether any personal
information had been accessed without authorization, and to identify the scope of individuals
affected. On October 9, 2019, the forensic investigation first revealed that personal information of
certain individuals may have been accessed without authorization, and the investigation continued
in subsequent time to identify the full scope of individuals affected. At present, the investigation has
revealed twenty-two (22) Maryland residents whose information may have been affected.
Wayside has implemented additional security features to safeguard personal information in its
possession and minimize the likelihood that an event like this could occur again in the future.
Wayside notified affected Maryland residents via the attached letter on November 15, 2019, and is

(“Golden”), this report is to notify you
of a data security incident.
Golden’s ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an
unauthorized individual obtained access to some employees’ email accounts. Upon first learning
of the incident, Golden immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an
investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist. Findings from the investigation
indicate that an unauthorized individual obtained access to the email accounts at various times
between May 30, 2019 and July 31, 2019. Golden conducted a comprehensive review of the emails
and attachments in the employees’ email accounts and, on October 8, 2019, determined that an
email or an attachment to an email in the email accounts may have included the name, Social
Security number, driver’s license number, passport number, and financial account numbers of 779
Maryland residents.
Today, Golden is beginning to mail notification letters to the 779 Maryland residents in
accordance with Md. Code Com. Law § 14-3504 via United States Postal Service First-Class mail.
Enclosed is a sample copy of the letter. Golden is offering one year of complimentary credit
monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian to individuals that had a Social
Security Number or Driver’s License Number contained in the email or attachment. Golden also
established a call center for the individuals to call with any questions regarding the incident.
To help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, Golden is implementing
additional safeguards and technical measures, including multi-factor authentication, and is
providing additional training to employees.

What Happened
Marriott learned on September 4, 2019, that an unknown person gained access to information about certain
Marriott associates by accessing the network of an outside vendor formerly used by Marriott. Once we became
aware, Marriott immediately confirmed that the vendor was taking appropriate to steps to investigate the
incident. The vendor reported that it was working with a forensic firm and had notified law enforcement. This
vendor served as Marriott’s agent for receiving service of official documents, such as subpoenas and court
orders. A document containing your information was sent to this vendor, and it was accessed during the
incident. This incident did not impact the security of Marriott’s internal HR systems or platforms.
What Information Was Involved
The information in the document received by this vendor that contains your information includes your name,
address, and Social Security number.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the “Company”) discovered that a third party acquired e-mail and password information from a source outside of the Company’s systems which was used to access less than 1% of the Company’s online customer accounts.

None of the Company’s online customers’ payment cards were compromised as a result of this incident. Since becoming aware of this incident, the Company retained a leading security forensics firm and has implemented remedial measures.

Due to the limited nature of the security incident and the Company’s cyber incident insurance coverage, the Company does not expect this security incident to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for any fiscal period.",https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000119312519277746/d798213d8k.htm,2019-10-29 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000088615820000008/0000886158-20-000008-index.htm,Risk Factors,2020-04-29 00:00:00,"The Company processes, transmits, stores and maintains certain information about its customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. In connection with certain activities, including, without limitation credit card processing, website hosting, data encryption and software support, the Company utilizes third party service providers, and the Company believes it takes appropriate steps to require such providers to secure such information and to assess their ability to do so. The Company invests considerable resources in protecting this sensitive information but is still subject to a possible security event, including but not limited to cybercrimes or cybersecurity attacks which may not be detected for a period of time. The recent shift to remote working by much of the Company’s workforce and the increase in online orders as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate these risks. A breach of its security systems or those of its third-party service providers resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information could negatively impact the Company’s operating results and financial performance. Certain aspects of the business, particularly the Company’s websites, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. A loss of consumer confidence from such a breach could result in lost future sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation. In addition, a breach or other type of cybercrime or cybersecurity attack could cause the Company to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of its data and systems, could require the devotion of significant management resources, and could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.

MONETT, Mo. – October 24, 2019 – Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.® (NASDAQ:JKHY), a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for the financial services industry, announced today that Geezeo, a subsidiary it acquired in July 2019, was recently informed by a third-party service provider that in May of this year, prior to its acquisition by Jack Henry, there was a security incident at that provider that involved a Geezeo account. 

Upon notification by the third-party provider, Geezeo immediately began investigating. In reviewing the information from the third-party provider, Geezeo discovered that its information was impacted and a 2012 data file may have been accessed.

There was no impact on Geezeo’s or Jack Henry’s operations and it does not appear that any password, security code, access code or other similar information that would permit access to a consumer’s financial account was accessed.

Geezeo has contacted all financial institutions that were affected. Proper remediation steps have been taken to contain the incident and to secure the company’s systems to help ensure that future incidents of this nature cannot occur. The appropriate regulatory bodies and federal law enforcement have been notified.

Charlie Wright, Chief Risk Officer of Jack Henry & Associates, said, “Safeguarding our clients’ information is essential to our mission. Although the incident occurred prior to our acquisition of Geezeo, I am grateful it has been contained. We appreciate the understandable worry the incident has caused for the small number of financial institutions that were affected.”",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/779152/000077915219000074/pr-corporatexgeezeoinc.htm,2109-10-24 00:00:00,ND,,,,,,,,,,,138.49000549316406,149.4499969482422,146.32000732421875,152.41000366210938,167.92999267578125,129.61000061035156,156.1999969482422,186.9199981689453,182.1199951171875,181.7700042724609,164.72999572753906,159.41000366210938,158.30999755859375,152.5,152.5

The open and publicly available instance contained a graph and description which immediately got my attention:

Here you can analyze the results of the full system scan that takes place every hour. It scans every appliance in the homes of our customers.

The scan retrieves the device shadow for each appliance. It can, among other things, determine whether the appliance is online or offline. It records that status over time for each appliance.



Graphs were supported by a MongoDB-sourced data and the database itself was sitting in public on the same IP where Heartbeat instance was hosted. Upon closer investigation, I came to conclusion that data was part of Whirlpool cloud infrastructure and database was used to collect the information from IoT connected home appliances, such as:

customer email
SAID number (smart appliance ID) – unique number used to sync a smart device with your appliance
model name and number
different attributes of the scanned appliance etc.
Database contained more than 28 Million of records (28,151,181), with information structured as per above.

I have immediately notified Whirlpool security team on the incident and within next 24 hours both database and service instance were pulled offline. Upon internal investigation which took several days, company provided me with the following statement:

Our company was recently made aware of a potential security concern with respect to one of its databases.  The database was immediately taken offline and secured. Our investigation showed that 48,000 emails were publicly available – but no confidential information was exposed. We are in the process of reaching out to impacted consumers. Our company appreciated this notification so the issue could be quickly addressed.

While I cannot verify or deny the number of emails compromised in this incident, I was still worried by the fact that smart appliances are scanned on a regular basis to gather emails and other attributions. You can call me old-fashioned but I would prefer to have an Internet-disconnected dishwasher these days.

The TransUnion incident is much more limited than the high-profile data hack at credit monitoring agency Equifax Inc. in 2017, which exposed the information of 147 million people, including about 19,000 Canadians.

TransUnion said in a statement Wednesday that someone fraudulently accessed its data through the use of one of its business customer's login credentials between June and July.

Company spokesperson David Blumberg said that while the investigation is ongoing, the company maintains that the fraudulent login was not a failure of its systems.

""The unauthorized access was not the result of a breach or failure of TransUnion's systems or our customer's system,"" he said.

Canadian Western Bank (CWB) confirmed that the credit report data was accessed through an account at its leasing division.

OPINIONKeeping private information private: Are credit monitoring systems worth the cost?
""In August, we learned that CWB National Leasing's account was illegally used by an unauthorized third party to perform unauthorized credit checks,"" said company spokesperson Maya Filipovic.

She said no personal information held by CWB National Leasing was taken, disclosed or misused in any way.

Type of personal information accessed
TransUnion did not disclose what kind of personal information was compromised by the fraudulent login.

A credit check by a bank or lender could give access to an individual's name, date of birth, current and former addresses, information on existing credit and loan obligations, credit repayment history and potentially their social insurance number.

TransUnion said it learned of the breach in August and has notified those whose information may have been accessed as well as the privacy commissioners.

The incident is the latest of numerous data breaches in recent years, including the Equifax breach. More recently, Capital One said in July that data of six million Canadians was hacked, including about a million social insurance numbers. Desjardins said in June that the data of about 2.7 million accounts was hit with a breach.

The problem is that no system is foolproof, said Hasan Cavusoglu, an associate professor of management information systems at the UBC Sauder School of Business.

""The reality is this is a moving target. Organizations are every day exposed to new type of attack vectors, new kinds of threat actors.""

He said customers have little choice but to have their data held with TransUnion and Equifax.

ANALYSISAnother day, another data hack — and truth is, there's not much you can do about it
""As long as you do some kind of transaction, your data will inevitably fall into these companies.""

The two credit monitoring agencies collect a variety of financial data to help banks and other lenders figure out how reliably a customer might pay them back. The model means the agencies want to collect as much information as possible to clearly represent someone's credit worthiness, said Cavusoglu.

While breaches are impossible to rule out entirely, major financial institutions like credit agencies have significant incentives to keep the data safe, he said.

""Reputational damage as a result of these kinds of attacks is tremendous, let alone other kind of maybe regulatory sort of penalties as well as some legal costs associated with it. So they don't want that reputational damage.""

Chicago-based TransUnion continues to look for ways to strengthen its defences against unauthorized access of any kind, and supports customers in efforts to protect their data, Blumberg said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,79.16000366210938,80.62000274658203,85.33999633789062,90.0199966430664,94.93000030517578,81.41000366210938,69.5,79.11000061035156,93.11000061035156,87.02999877929688,87.37999725341797,83.0199966430664,88.54000091552734,83.0,77.95333333333333

What FIFA 20 player information was leaked?
The information that was leaked included username, email address, country of residence and date of birth. A brief statement was made by EA Sports via Twitter more than four hours after the FIFA 20 registration process opened. ""We take these matters seriously, and we immediately took down the page while we investigate the matter,"" it said, ""We'll share updates as soon as possible.""

The updated EA Sports response
That update from EA Sports came the following day. This states that shortly after the registration portal page for the FIFA Global Series was announced at 1 p.m. (BST) on October 3, it learned some players trying to register were seeing information relating to those already signed up. ""We immediately took action to shut down the site by 1.30 p.m."" the statement reads, ""We were able to root cause the issue and implement a fix to be clear that information is protected."" EA Sports said that it is confident that players will not be impacted by the same issue going forward.

EA Sports has said that it determined some 1,600 FIFA 20 players were potentially affected by the data leak and is taking ""steps to contact those competitors with more details and protect their EA accounts.""

Today In: Innovation
The potential FIFA 20 data leak fallout
The irony of the data leak occurring within hours of Electronic Arts announcing a free month of Origin Access Basic for users enabling two-factor authentication to secure their accounts has not been lost. Nor, indeed, has the fact that this could be a very costly misstep in what is National Cyber Security Month: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules could see EA Sports facing a hefty fine of up to 4% of annual revenue if the leak was caused by neglect.

FIFA 20 players have already taken to Twitter to demand compensation by way of free ""packs"" containing players, club items, staff and consumables. Although just as many players are demanding EA Sports fix problems with ""career mode"" in the game as have been complaining about the data leak, it has to be said.

The security expert view
Security experts certainly don’t think that this leak is a Premier League contender like the recent Zynga hack that potentially affected more than 200 million gamers. ""In light of the disastrous data breaches of 2019, exposing billions of highly-sensitive datasets, this incident is rather of a minor gravity,"" Ilia Kolochenko, founder and CEO of web security company ImmuniWeb, said.

Updated Notice Regarding 2016 Security Incident

Relevant to Zendesk Customers with Accounts Activated Prior to November 1, 2016
We recently were alerted by a third party regarding a security matter that may have affected the Zendesk Support and Chat products and customer accounts of those products activated prior to November of 2016. While our investigation is still ongoing, on September 24, 2019, we determined that information belonging to a small percentage of customers was accessed prior to November of 2016.

We deeply regret that this incident occurred. The safety and security of our customers and their data is of paramount importance to us. Our goal is to communicate this information as quickly as possible with transparency and guidance on how to address. We will be updating and sharing more information in this blog post and our help center as it becomes available.
For further information, please go to our frequently asked questions/FAQ page or contact the dedicated team available to answer questions on this issue at security.support@zendesk.com.

What happened and what does this mean to you?
Once we became aware of this security matter, the Zendesk Security teams launched an investigation into the incident, including:

Engaging a team of outside forensic experts to validate the claims of the third party and to determine the exact data and information that was exposed
Activating our internal data security response team and protocol. This team continues to investigate with full resources dedicated to determining how this exposure occurred
Informing law enforcement and the appropriate global regulatory agencies
On September 24, we identified approximately 15,000 Zendesk Support and Chat accounts, including expired trial accounts and accounts that are no longer active, whose account information was accessed without authorization prior to November of 2016. Information accessed included some personally identifiable information (PII) and other Service Data. We have found no evidence that ticket data was accessed in connection with this incident.

For impacted customers, the information accessed from these databases includes the following data:

Email addresses, names and phone numbers of agents and end-users of certain Zendesk products, potentially up to November 2016
Agent and end user passwords that were hashed and salted – a security technique used to make them difficult to decipher, potentially up to November 2016. We have found no evidence that these passwords were used to access any Zendesk services in connection with this incident.
UPDATE: We have also determined that certain authentication information was accessed for approximately 7,000 customer accounts, including expired trial accounts and accounts that are no longer active. Upon further analysis, we also found an error and identified a group of customers who had a small number of TLS certificates accessed, almost all of which are currently expired.

Here is the information impacted:

Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption keys provided to Zendesk by customers
Configuration settings of apps installed from the Zendesk app marketplace or private apps. This may include integration keys used by those apps to authenticate against third party services.
What has been done to remedy the situation?
We are taking specific steps to ensure that all potentially impacted customers are protected. These steps include the following actions:

We are informing all impacted customers directly and sharing the steps we are taking to safeguard their accounts and data and additional actions they can take themselves.
As a precautionary measure, in the next 24 hours, we are starting to implement password rotations for all active agents in Support and Chat, and all end users in Support created prior to November 1, 2016. This password rotation will impact all other products which share authentication with Support, including Guide, Talk and Explore. Upon their next login, each of these users will be required to create a new password. You will not be impacted by this if we have been able to identify that you have updated your password since November 1, 2016 or have implemented Single Sign-on in connection with your account.
We are continuing our investigation including working with outside forensics experts and law enforcement.
As a Zendesk customer, what do I need to do?
If you have received an email from us saying that you had an account prior to November 1, 2016, we recommend that you take the following steps:

If you installed a Zendesk Marketplace or private app prior to November 1, 2016 that saved authentication credentials such as API keys or passwords during installation, we recommend that you rotate all credentials for the respective app.
In addition, if you uploaded a TLS certificate to Zendesk prior to November 1, 2016 which is still valid, we recommend you upload a new certificate, and revoke the old one
While we have no indication at this time that other authentication credentials were accessed, customers may want to consider rotating authentication credentials used in Zendesk products prior to November 1, 2016. API Tokens in Chat do not need to be rotated.

“We recently discovered that an unauthorized party may have gained access to certain Thinkful company credentials so, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all of our users,” said Erin Rosenblatt, the company’s vice-president of operations, in an email to users.

“As soon as we discovered this unauthorized access, we promptly changed the credentials, took additional steps to enhance the security measures we have in place, and initiated a full investigation,” the executive said.

At the time of writing, there has been no public acknowledgement of the breach beyond the email to users.

Thinkful, based in Brooklyn, New York, provides education and training for developers and programmers. The company claims the vast majority of its graduates get jobs in their field of study within a half-year of finishing their program. Earlier this month, education tech giant Chegg bought Thinkful for $80 million in cash.

But the company would not say when the breach happened — or if Chegg  knew of the data breach prior to the acquisition announcement.

A spokesperson for Chegg did not respond to a request for comment. Thinkful spokesperson Catherine Zuppe did not respond to several emails of questions about the breach.

The email to users said the stolen credentials could not have granted the hacker access to certain information, such as government-issued IDs and Social Security numbers, or financial information. But although the company said it’s seen “no evidence” of any unauthorized access to users’ account data, it did not rule out any improper access to user data.

Thinkful said it is requiring all users to change their passwords.

We also asked Thinkful what security measures it has employed since the credentials breach, such as employing two-factor authentication, but did not hear back.

Just months earlier, Chegg confirmed a data breach, which forced the online technology giant to reset the passwords of its 40 million users.

At least Thinkful is now in good company.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495419000251/0001364954-19-000251-index.htm,Risk Factors,2019-11-04 00:00:00,"For instance, in April 2018, an unauthorized party gained access to user data for chegg.com and certain of our family of brands such as EasyBib (the 2018 Data Incident).

To date, no social security numbers or financial information such as users' credit card numbers or bank account information were obtained. Additionally, Thinkful, prior to our acquisition of it, discovered an unauthorized party may have gained access to certain Thinkful company credentials (the Thinkful Data Incident).

I am writing on behalf of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park” or the “Company”) pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Comm.
Law §14-3504 to inform you of a data security incident. Park is a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT)
comprised of a geographically diverse portfolio of hotels and resorts. Park was established as an independent
company following its spin-off from Hilton in January 2017.
On July 30, 2019, the Company became aware of suspicious activity relating to its Microsoft Office 365 email
environment. The suspicious activity was promptly halted and Park launched an extensive investigation involving
external forensic experts. Park subsequently determined that as the result of a phishing scheme, an unauthorized
actor potentially accessed Park emails in a single employee’s email account, including emails containing sensitive
personal information. Most of the information pertains to current or former Park employees and some individuals
with whom Park does business.
Sixteen Maryland residents may have had their sensitive information affected by this incident. The scope of the
incident may have included access to emails that included information such as full names, physical addresses, and
some combination of Social Security numbers, government-issued identification information (such as driver’s
licenses or passport numbers), bank information, credit card number, or Taxpayer Identification Number.
Later today, the Company will send notice by regular mail to those residents. A sample copy of the notice is
enclosed. In addition to providing affected individuals with information regarding credit reporting agencies, security
freezes, fraud alerts, and other identity theft prevention tools, the Company is also offering all affected individuals
credit monitoring and identity restoration services for two years through Experian Identity Restoration and
IdentityWorks. We are also reviewing and updating our security practices to help prevent this type of incident from
occurring again.

Dear Zynga Player,
We are writing to let you know about an incident we recently discovered that involved some of our
players’ non-financial account information.
What happened
We recently discovered that, on or about August 31, 2019, outside hackers may have illegally accessed
certain player account information. An investigation, supported by leading third-party forensics firms,
was immediately commenced. We believe that your Zynga username and password may have been
obtained, which is why you are receiving this notice.
What information was involved
The personal information involved may have included your Zynga profile- or user- name, and Zynga
password. Zynga does not collect player social security numbers, and our current understanding is that
no financial information was accessed.
What we are doing
As a precaution, we have taken steps to protect users’ accounts from invalid logins. We also have notified
law enforcement of the incident. California law requires us to inform you that this notice has not been
delayed because of law enforcement investigation. Zynga has also taken steps to further enhance the
security of its systems that contain personal information.
What you can do
Additional information about what you can do is available on our Player Support page here.
For more information
If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact us by email by filling out the
following form.
The security of our player data is extremely important to us. We have worked hard to address this matter
and remain committed to supporting our community.

We represent Brixmor Property Group (“Brixmor”), 450 Lexington Avenue, Floor 13, New York,
NY 10017 and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of
personal information relating to Maryland residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing,
and this notice may be supplemented if new significant facts are learned subsequent to its
submission. By providing this notice, Brixmor does not waive any rights or defenses regarding
the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute,
or personal jurisdiction.
Background
Brixmor recently learned of an unauthorized login by a third party to a limited number of Brixmor
employee email accounts. Brixmor immediately changed the employees’ credentials and launched
an internal investigation to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. A forensic
investigation firm was retained to assist with Brixmor’s investigation. On June 14, 2019, the
investigation confirmed that an unauthorized actor logged in to the impacted accounts one time on
May 26, 2019 for a very limited period of time.
The emails and attachments contained within the impacted email accounts were programmatically
and manually reviewed as the investigation was unable to determine which emails or attachments,
if any were accessed or viewed. On July 9, 2019 Brixmor determined what information was
accessible within the accounts and to whom that information related. Over the following weeks,
Brixmor obtained contact information for all impacted individuals. 
Office of the Attorney General

Notice to Maryland Residents
On September 9, 2019, Brixmor began mailing written notice of this incident to the individuals
whose information was accessible within the email accounts, which includes approximately two
(2) Maryland residents. Notice was mailed in substantially the same form as the letter attached
hereto as Exhibit A.
Brixmor is providing those individuals whose information was accessible within the email
accounts access to one year of credit monitoring through TransUnion. Additionally, Brixmor is
providing potentially impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity
theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's
credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how
to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft
by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact
the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report
attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. Brixmor is also providing written notice of this
incident to other state regulators as necessary.

I represent MGM Resorts International (“MGM”), an international hospitality corporation, with respect to a
recent data security incident. MGM is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. This letter is submitted on behalf
of MGM pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Comm. Law 14-3504,, because the personal information of twentythree (23) Maryland residents may have been affected by the incident.
On or about July 7, 2019, an outside unknown individual (“UI”) accessed MGM’s internal system without
authorization and exfiltrated data by exploiting a compromised account concerning a third-party integration.
The UI then posted the data on a closed internet forum on July 10, 2019 with the intent to sell for financial
gain. The data was taken down from the forum on or about July 24, 2019. Outside legal counsel engaged
with two forensic investigation firms to conduct an analysis of the data. The vast majority of information
contained within the data set included names, addresses, and phone numbers. No MGM customer financial
information or passwords were accessed.
After a voluminous and time-intensive search, on August 9, MGM determined that eight (8) Maryland
driver’s licenses and fifteen (15) Maryland military identification numbers were accessed.
MGM is in the process of notifying affected residents via the attached letter. MGM is offering twelve (12)

TOANO, Va., August 27, 2019 – Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL), a leading specialty retailer of hard-surface flooring in North America, today provided information on a recent network security incident. Beginning today, Tuesday, August 27, 2019, with very few exceptions, stores regained the ability to transact using normal point of sales systems, and much of the customer-facing impact of the incident has been resolved. Restoration efforts continue, and the Company, is in the early stages of broader recovery efforts and forensic analysis that are expected to last several weeks.

 

Although the investigation remains ongoing, to date, the Company has not discovered anything that leads it to believe any sensitive and confidential consumer or employee data was compromised. That data is further protected by the fact that the vast majority of customer and employee data, including customer credit card information, is secured and maintained on systems outside of the Company’s network.

 

The Company first discovered the incident at approximately 9:15 am on Wednesday, August 21, 2019, when its network and computer systems began to manifest symptoms of malware that ultimately disabled certain corporate and store systems nationwide. The Company took immediate action to contain the incident and, within hours, the information technology team had mobilized to diagnose and begin remediation processes, including securing outside expertise to help ensure the Company could return to normal operations as soon as possible. In addition, employees have worked diligently to implement established business continuity procedures, and stores have remained open and serving customers throughout this incident.

 

“Our first priority has been to continue to serve our customers and aid our store employees in that effort,” commented Dennis Knowles, President and Chief Executive Officer. “I would like to thank the many employees who exhibited ingenuity and made personal sacrifices to ensure our customers’ needs were met.”

 

“Our diligent work over the past several years to develop system redundancies and business continuity plans paid dividends that were made apparent in our ability to remain open while working to restore our systems,” Knowles continued. “We used manual workarounds to facilitate transactions and brought in outside resources to help ensure we returned to normal operations as soon as possible, but I would also like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during this event.”

 

The Company maintains cyber-security and other insurance and has been working collaboratively with its carrier throughout this incident, although it is too early in the restoration and recovery process to determine the net impact of costs and recoveries on the Company’s financial results. The Company will provide periodic updates as appropriate or required.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1396033/000114420419041866/tv528399_ex99-1.htm,2019-08-27 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1396033/000155837019010027/0001558370-19-010027-index.htm,Risk Factors | MDA,2019-11-06 00:00:00,"In August 2019, we experienced a network security incident caused by malware that prevented access to several of our information technology systems and data.  Following the discovery of the incident, we promptly took actions to isolate and shut down affected systems based on our existing protocols.  We implemented our business continuity plan and undertook actions to recover the affected systems; we believe we were successfully able to restore the operation of the systems without loss of business data.  Based on the nature of the network security incident, the impact on our information technology systems and the results of the forensic IT analysis, we do not believe confidential customer, employee, or company data was lost or disclosed, but we continue to monitor the situation.  Our stores remained open and operating throughout the incident, but were utilizing manual back-up processes for approximately six days which we believe had an adverse impact on sales.  We maintain cyber-security and other insurance and have been working collaboratively with our carriers throughout this incident.  As of September 30, 2019, we estimate the equipment replaced and costs associated with the incident to date to be approximately $3.5 million.  Prior to quarter end, we received an initial recovery from insurance in excess of $2 million, capitalized new equipment, and recorded approximately $0.7 million as a receivable related to further anticipated recovery.

Mossab Hussein, a security researcher at Dubai-based cybersecurity firm SpiderSilk, found an exposed database on one of the company’s many subdomains. The database was massive, containing 161 million records at the time of writing and growing in real time. Many of the records were normal computer-generated logging messages used to ensure the running of the service — but many also included sensitive user information, such as MoviePass customer card numbers.

These MoviePass customer cards are like normal debit cards: they’re issued by Mastercard and store a cash balance, which users who sign up to the subscription service can use to pay to watch a catalog of movies. For a monthly subscription fee, MoviePass uses the debit card to load the full cost of the movie, which the customer then uses to pay for the movie at the cinema.

We reviewed a sample of 1,000 records and removed the duplicates. A little over half contained unique MoviePass debit card numbers. Each customer card record had the MoviePass debit card number and its expiry date, the card’s balance and when it was activated.

The database had more than 58,000 records containing card data — and was growing by the minute.

We also found records containing customers’ personal credit card numbers and their expiry date — which included billing information, including names and postal addresses. Among the records we reviewed, we found records with enough information to make fraudulent card purchases.

Some records, however, contained card numbers that had been masked except for the last four digits.

The database also contained email address and some password data related to failed login attempts. We found hundreds of records containing users’ email addresses and presumably incorrectly typed passwords — which was logged — in the database. We verified this by attempting to log into the app with an email address and password that didn’t exist but only we knew. Our dummy email address and password appeared in the database almost immediately.

None of the records in the database were encrypted.

Hussain contacted MoviePass chief executive Mitch Lowe  by email — which TechCrunch has seen — over the weekend but did not hear back. It was only after TechCrunch reached out Tuesday when MoviePass took the database offline.

The database was exposed for months. Yonathan Klijnsma, threat researcher at cyberthreat intelligence firm RiskIQ, found evidence that the database was open from early May. Then, after we published this story, security researcher Nitish Shah told TechCrunch he also found the exposed database months earlier. “I even notified them, but they [didn’t bother] to reply or fix it,” he said. He provided a screenshot of the exposed database for proof, which we verified.

We asked MoviePass several questions — including why the initial email disclosing the security lapse was ignored, for how long the server was exposed and its plans to disclose the incident to customers and state regulators.

Almost a day after we published, MoviePass acknowledged the security incident in a boilerplate statement but did not answer our questions.

“MoviePass recently discovered a security vulnerability that may have exposed customer records. After discovering the vulnerability, we immediately secured our systems to prevent further exposure and to mitigate the potential impact of this incident,” said Lowe. “MoviePass takes this incident seriously and is dedicated to protecting our customers’ information. We are working diligently to investigate the scope of this incident and its potential impact on our customers. Once we gain a full understanding of the incident, we will promptly notify any affected subscribers and the appropriate regulators or law enforcement.”

MoviePass has been on a roller coaster since it hit mainstream audiences last year. The company quickly grew its customer base from 1.5 million to 2 million customers in less than a month. But MoviePass took a tumble after critics said it grew too fast, forcing the company to cease operating briefly after the company ran out of money. The company later said it was profitable, but then suspended service, supposedly to work on its mobile app. It now says it has “restored [service] to a substantial number of our current subscribers.”

Leaked internal data from April said its customer numbers went from three million subscribers to about 225,000. And just this month MoviePass reportedly changed user passwords to hobble access for customers who use the service extensively.

Hussein said the company was negligent in leaving data unencrypted in an exposed, accessible database.

“We keep on seeing companies of all sizes using dangerous methods to maintain and process private user data,” Hussein told TechCrunch. “In the case of MoviePass, we are questioning the reason why would internal technical teams ever be allowed to see such critical data in plaintext — let alone the fact that the data set was exposed for public access by anyone,” he said.

The security researcher said he found the exposed database using his company-built web mapping tools, which peeks into non-password protected databases that are connected to the internet, and identifies the owner. The information is privately disclosed to companies, often in exchange for a bug bounty.

Hussein has a history of finding exposed databases. In recent months he found one of Samsung’s development labs exposed on the internet. He also found an exposed backend database belonging to Blind, an anonymity-driven workplace social network, exposing private user data.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,0.0017000000225380065,0.0024000001139938827,0.003000000026077032,0.0027000000700354576,0.0026499999221414328,0.0024500000290572643,0.0003000000142492353,0.0003000000142492353,0.00019999999494757506,0.0013000000035390258,0.0010000000474974509,0.000699999975040555,0.0005499999970197678,,

In May 2019, Cable One learned that an unauthorized individual, through a third-party vendor, obtained access to approximately 14 Cable One employee email accounts.  These employee email accounts contained certain personal information about some current and former employees as well as, in some cases, their dependents, beneficiaries and others.  Upon learning of the unauthorized access, the company immediately took action to block further access, promptly initiated an investigation and engaged an independent cybersecurity forensic firm and notified federal law enforcement.  The investigation found no evidence that this incident involved unauthorized access to or use of any of Cable One's internal computer systems or networks. Additionally, Cable One has no evidence that any customer information was involved.

Although Cable One is not aware of any fraud or misuse of information as a result of this incident, the company has sent letters to inform potentially affected individuals about the incident and is offering identity protection services.

""We deeply apologize for any worry and frustration this situation may cause our employees as well as their family members and loved ones. Safeguarding the personal information of our employees and our customers has been, and will continue to be, a top priority for Cable One,"" said Cable One President and CEO Julie Laulis.  ""We will continue to invest in cybersecurity to protect the private information of both our employees and customers, and learnings from this incident will be incorporated into future security measures to further enhance our cyber defenses.""

What Information Was Involved
The information stored in the accessed email accounts varies by individual, but may include categories of information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, digital signatures, medical, or health insurance. 

What Cable One Is Doing
Based on investigation analysis to date, it is believed unlikely that the information stored in the employee email accounts was used for fraud, however the company will continue to investigate.  To help prevent this type of incident from reoccurring in the future, Cable One is continuing to review and enhance security measures and access controls for the company's email system. 

Cable One is notifying potentially affected individuals through a variety of channels. Additionally, the company is providing free identity protection services as well as information, services and resources to help potentially affected individuals protect their identities. This includes an ""Information About Identity Theft Protection"" reference guide available on the Cable One website at www.cableone.net.    

What You Can Do
Although Cable One is not aware of any misuse of information as a result of this incident, potentially affected individuals may wish to take action as a precaution.  In order to help protect themselves, individuals can review credit reports for accounts that they did not open or for inquiries from creditors that they did not initiate.  If individuals see anything that they do not understand, they should call the credit agency for information.  Further, individuals are encouraged to review their credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible in order to determine if there are any discrepancies or unusual activity listed.  The company urges individuals to remain vigilant and continue to monitor statements for unusual activity going forward.  If they see anything that they do not understand or that looks suspicious, or if they suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, individuals should immediately notify the issuer of the credit or debit card.  In instances of payment card fraud, it is important to note that cardholders are typically not responsible for any fraudulent activity that is reported in a timely fashion. Additionally, individuals can review explanation of benefits statements that they receive from their health insurer or health plan or review for persons whose medical bills they assist with or pay (such as a dependent).  If they identify services listed on the explanation of benefits that were not received, they should contact their insurer or health plan.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1632127/000143774920003799/0001437749-20-003799-index.htm,Risk factors,2020-02-28 00:00:00,"For example, in 2019 we identified an information security incident that could affect the personal information of some of our current and former associates as well as, in some cases, their dependents, beneficiaries and others.

Comparitech, in collaboration with security researcher Bob Diachenko, found an unsecured database containing data belonging to the hotel franchise on July 2, 2019, after the database was indexed by the BinaryEdge search engine.

The MongoDB database was available to the public with no password or authentication in play, leaving a total of 5.6 million records exposed. 

According to Choice Hotels, the bulk of the records was only test information, including the payment card, password, and reservation fields; however, 700,000 records were genuine and contained information on guests such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. 

Diachenko made Choice Hotels aware of the security incident on the same day of his discovery. However, someone with less honorable intentions got there first.

While investigating the database, the researcher found a ransom note. The message claimed that 700,000 records had been stolen and backed up elsewhere and demanded 0.4 Bitcoin (BTC), approximately $4,000 at the time of writing, from the owners.

It is possible that the note was placed there by an automated script hunting for public MongoDB databases and the researcher believes that the hackers may have intended to wipe the database after copying the data. 

This would have placed serious pressure on the vendor to pay up, but thankfully, the wipe failed.

Database access was closed off on July 2 and it appears the system was exposed for a total of four days. Choice Hotels says the database, while linked to the firm, was operated by a partner vendor and no internal Choice Hotels servers were accessed. 

""The vendor was working with the data as part of a proposal to provide a tool,"" a Choice Hotels spokesperson said. 

Due to the security lapse, the hotel franchise will not be working with the unnamed vendor in question. However, it did take a further nudge by Diachenko on July 28 for the company to commit to launching an investigation. 

It is not believed at this stage that any financial information or Social Security numbers were involved in the data breach, but this does not mean the apparent theft could impact customers.

The data stolen may end up being used in tailored phishing campaigns, for example, in which names and contact details will be used to make malicious messages appear genuine -- either via email or text -- for the purpose of grabbing more sensitive and valuable information. Increased levels of spam arriving in guest inboxes are also possible. 

""We are evaluating other vendor relationships and working to put additional controls in place to prevent any future occurrences of this nature,"" Choice Hotels told Comparitech. ""We are also establishing a Responsible Disclosure Program, and we welcome Mr. Diachenko's assistance in helping us identify any gaps.""", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,87.69999694824219,94.37999725341795,87.88999938964844,91.29000091552734,101.3499984741211,99.9000015258789,104.5999984741211,74.12999725341797,72.97000122070312,70.4000015258789,83.80000305175781,81.4000015258789,94.76000213623048,81.0,59.53333333333333

(“Amarin”) about a
security matter involving a database maintained by the vendor that may have contained certain information about you.
According to the vendor, this database does not contain your financial account information, credit card information, or
Social Security number, but it may include your name, address, and your interest in a copay card for Vascepa®, an Amarin
product. The vendor is an independent company that supports Amarin’s copay assistance programs by providing customer
relationship management services relating to Vascepa®. Amarin’s systems were not affected by this incident. At this time,
we have no reason to believe that your data has been misused for fraud or identity theft.
What Happened
On or around June 20, 2019, we became aware of media reports suggesting that a database containing information about
consumers who use or have expressed interest in Vascepa® may have been subject to unauthorized access. Amarin
promptly began investigating these reports and determined that the database in question was maintained by the vendor.
Amarin promptly took steps to suspend active data feeds to the vendor’s database, and the vendor informed us that the
database was taken offline on June 20, 2019.
On July 11, 2019, the vendor informed us that due to a database misconfiguration, information could have been accessed
without proper authorization between May 2, 2018, and June 20, 2019. The vendor further informed us that it identified
evidence of unauthorized access to and acquisition of information from the database during the period May 29, 2019 to
June 20, 2019, and that it could not conclusively determine that no unauthorized access or acquisition occurred outside
this timeframe. We are not certain whether your specific data was accessed or acquired and are not aware of your data
being misused for fraud or identity theft.
What Information Was Involved
According to the vendor, information in the database subject to unauthorized access and acquisition included names,
postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and information about consumers’ use of certain supplements or medications,
including Vascepa®. The database also contained information about certain copay transactions for Vascepa®, including
dates the transactions were completed. The vendor confirmed the database did not contain Social Security numbers or
financial account information.

Some months back, I published an article on “Exposed JIRA server leaks NASA staff and project data” in which I was able to find NASA staff details, their username, their email ids along with their internal project details which were getting leaked by one of their tools — JIRA which is an Atlassian task tracking systems/project management software used by around 135,000 companies and organization globally. The root cause behind the leak was the wild misconfiguration which was present in JIRA. Why the term “wild” being used is because, with the help of the same misconfiguration, I happened to access internal user data, internal project details of hundreds and thousands of companies which were using JIRA.
Lots of companies were from Alexa and Fortune top lists as well. The affected customers ranges from companies as big as NASA, Google, Yahoo to Go-Jek, HipChat, Zendesk, Sapient, Dubsmash, Western union, Lenovo, 1password, Informatica, etc and many sectors of various government around the world also suffered the same privacy issue like one of the portal of European government, United Nations, NASA, Brazilian government transport portal, Canadain governement finance portal.
where due to some misconfiguration issues in JIRA, their internal user data, their name, email ids, their project details on which they were working, assignee of those projects and various other information were getting exposed.
Here, I’ll be sharing about what was that critical vulnerability that I happened to find in Jira (An Atlassian task tracking systems/project management software) or more specifically a misconfiguration issue which caused the leakage of internal sensitive information of organization and companies. Let’s see what was the exact issue —
In Jira, while creating filters or dashboards it provides some visibility option to apply to them. The issue was due to the wrong permissions assigned to them. When the filters and dashboards for the projects/issues are created in JIRA, then by default the visibility is set to “All users” and “Everyone” respectively, which instead of sharing with everyone of the organizations (which people think and interpret), it share them publically. There is also a user picker functionality in Jira which gives a complete list of every user’s username and email address. This information disclosure is the result of an authorization misconfiguration in Jira’s Global Permissions settings. Because of the wrong permissions scheme, the following internal information appeared to be vulnerable:
all account’s employees’ names and emails,
employees’ roles through JIRA groups,
current projects, upcoming milestones through JIRA dashboards/filters
Anyone with the link can access them from anywhere and get hold of various sensitive information and because they are being indexed by all the search engines so anyone can easily find them with some simple search queries.

NASA Staff data because of misconfigured Jira user picker functionality

Jira Filter Publically accessible

Jira Dashboard Publically accessible

NASA Project details getting exposed due to public Filter and dashboard
As can be seen above, it discloses employees names, employee roles, upcoming milestones, secret project, and various other features due to these misconfigured Jira settings.
Now, how I found the links/URLs of these publically exposed user picker functionality, filters, and dashboards of so many companies and the help came from “Google dorks” (search query). To search for the companies having user picker functionality in Jira as misconfigured and so the complete list of their staff username and email address exposed, here is the search query —
inurl:/UserPickerBrowser.jspa -intitle:Login -intitle:Log

This query list all the URLs having “UserPickerBrowser” in their URI to find all the misconfigured Jira User picker functionality which are publically exposed and also not authenticated.

Google Acquisition Apigee staff data publicly exposed

Go-jek staff data publicly exposed

NASA Staff data exposed by misconfigured Jira
While for filters and dashboards, we can see the URLs of these filters and dashboards containing “Managefilters” and “ConfigurePortal” as a part. I went on to create the search query —
inurl:/ManageFilters.jspa?filterView=popular AND ( intext:All users OR intext:Shared with the public OR intext:Public )
This query list all the URLs having “Managefilters” in their URI and having text as “Public” so to find all the misconfigured JIRA filters which are publically exposed and also not authenticated.

inurl:/ConfigurePortalPages!default.jspa?view=popular
This query list all the URLs having “ConfigurePortalPages” in their URI to find all the JIRA dashboard which are publically exposed.

On further recon(information gathering), I have found that various companies have JIRA URL in the format “company.atlassian.net” so if you want to check for any company who have misconfigured filter, dashboard or user picker functionality, you need to just put their name in the URL like —
https://companyname.atlassian.net/secure/popups/UserPickerBrowser.jspa
https://companyname.atlassian.net/secure/ManageFilters.jspa?filterView=popular 
https://companyname.atlassian.net/secure/ConfigurePortalPages!default.jspa?view=popular 
Thousands of companies filters, dashboards and staff data were publically exposed. It occurs because of the wrong permissions scheme set to filters and dashboards hence providing their access even to non-logged in users and hence leading to leaking of sensitive data. I have discovered several such misconfigured JIRA accounts in hundreds of companies. Some of the companies were from Alexa and Fortune top list including big giants like NASA, Google, Yahoo, etc and government sites as well like —
The Brazilian government has Jira filter misconfigured of their Road and Transport system hence exposing some of their project details, employee names, etc which was fixed after reaching out to them.
Similarly, the United Nations accidentally made their Jira filters and Jira dashboard public hence exposed their internal project details, secrets milestones, etc which was fixed by them after I reported it and was rewarded by them in their Hall of fame list.
Even the European government suffered the same exposure when their Commercial finance software systems and solutions had the same Jira misconfiguration and exposing their internal sensitive project and staff details. They also fixed it after I sent out the report to them and was also recognized in their Hall of fame list.

NASA Jira filters publicly accessible

Gov.uk Jira Filters publicly accessible

Informatica Jira filters publically exposed

Zendesk Jira dashboard publically exposed

Swiggy Jira filters publically exposed

Informatica Jira dashboard publically exposed

Western union staff data exposed

Luminate yahoo acquisition having Jira filters publically exposed
These publically available filters and dashboards were providing details such as employees roles, employees names, their mail id, upcoming milestones, secret project, and features. While the user picker functionality discloses internal user data. Useful information for a competitor company to get to know about the kind of upcoming milestones or secret projects their competitor is working upon. Even an attacker can gain some information from this and tie it with some other type of attacks. Clearly, it is something which shouldn’t be public. Not a security issue but more of a privacy issue.
I reported this to various companies, some rewarded me, some fixed it while some are still living with it. While it is more of a misconfiguration issue which Atlassian(JIRA) must take care of and be more explicitly clear about what is meant by “Any logged-in user” whether it is any logged-in user of JIRA or just a logged-in user belonging to a specific Jira company account.

Filter visibility settings
and set the visibility to “Private” by default and if anyone wants to make their dashboard or filter public, they have to explicitly go to the setting and change them. While user picker functionality settings must also be taken into account.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,143.9199981689453,134.50999450683594,124.2699966430664,122.36000061035156,120.83999633789062,120.33999633789062,147.0,146.82000732421875,134.05000305175778,154.58999633789062,188.32000732421875,185.6100006103516,176.64999389648438,,

I was searching Shodan yet again when I discovered an ElasticSearch database without any authentication. The data contained within this database was related to the internal network and computers of Honda Motor Company. The information available in the database appeared to be something like a inventory of all Honda internal machines. This included information such as machine hostname, MAC address, internal IP, operating system version, which patches had been applied, and the status of Honda's endpoint security software. I would like to thank the security team at Honda Motor Company for their very prompt action to secure the database shortly after being notified.

About Honda Motor Company
As of 2015, Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world.  They have an approximate market cap of 46.8B.  Honda has offices spread across the world, including Japan, United States, Great Britain, Mexico, and other locations.

Statement shared by Honda
Thank you very much for pointing out the vulnerability.  The security issue you identified could have potentially allowed outside parties to access  some of Honda’s cloud-based data that consisted of information related to our employees and their computers. We investigated the system’s access logs and found no signs of data download by any third parties.  At this moment, there is no evidence that data was  leaked, excluding the screenshots taken by you.  We will take appropriate actions in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, and will continue to work on proactive security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Background:
Based on the Shodan scan of the IP in question (which I am intentionally not linking to), it appears that the database was likely publically accessible as of July 1, 2019.


Initially it was challenging to locate a human at Honda Motor Company. I requested assistance on Twitter, and several very helpful folks reached out with offers of assistance. Through one of these contacts I was able to reach Honda's security team on July 6th, and they promptly took action to secure the database.

How much data?
The exposed ElasticSearch database contained approximately 134M documents which translated to roughly 40GB of data.


Data in the database appeared to go as far back as March 13, 2019 or roughly 3.5 months of data.


To get an estimate of data volume I looked back at the previous 30 days of time, and observed that roughly 40,000 data points were being added to the database nearly every day. There is an anomalous spike in data volume around mid-March 2019 that I did not investigate. It seems likely that this could have been something like an initial load of data into the database given that the database seems to have only come online on March 13th.


What was exposed?
Initially I assumed this data was a likely to be from a single Honda dealership. This seemed like a far more likely scenario. With additional digging it quickly became clear that this was a much broader data set that contained data related to all of Honda's global network of employee machines.


It seems the ""empty string"" value for the ""company"" field corresponded with Honda's offices in Japan. The bulk of the data was related to those employees, but as you can see several other offices were also included in the data. The screenshot only shows the top 5 values, not all possible values.

A few quick notes:
Before I get into the specifics of what information was contained within the leak I wanted to touch on why this data is sensitive.

What makes this data particularly dangerous in the hands of an attacker is that it shows you exactly where the soft spots are. I am specifically not going to name the major endpoint security vendor that protects Honda's machines, but the data makes it clear which vendor they use and which machines have the endpoint security software enabled and up to date. The data seems to show you which machines do not have endpoint security enabled, which machines are running older operating systems, and if you have a particular vulnerability you could quickly search for machines that have not been patched yet using this data. As I'll show in later screenshots this data contained enough identifiable information to make it extremely simple to locate specific high value employees (such as the CEO, CFO, CSO, etc). In the hands of an attacker this leaked data could be used to silently monitor those executives to identify ways to launch very targeted attacks. One of the tables of data seems to provide a list of machines that do not have endpoint security software in place. This is my guess based on the naming scheme and the data in the table. If an attacker is looking for a way into Honda's network knowing which machines are far less likely to identify/block their attacks would be critical information. These ""uncontrolled machines"" could very easily be the open door into the entire network.

During the course of this disclosure process Honda requested a number of redactions be made to the following screenshots. I agreed to make a number of these redactions for obviously sensitive content. I have no intention of oversharing. That being said, I did not make all the requested redactions where I felt they were over inclusive and not referring to sensitive data.

The ""ad_com_all"" table
This table included the employee name, host name, operating system(OS) type, and the OS version. Roughly 300,000 data points per cycle of data being updated.


The ""ad_user_all"" table
This table included the employee email address, employee name, department, last login, employee number, account name, and a mobile field (I didn't see values populated though). Slightly less than 300,000 data points per update.


The ""comterminal"" table
This table included the employee email, department, machine IP address, MAC address, host name, operating system, machine type, endpoint security state, and which Windows KB/patches had been applied. Roughly 40,000 data points per update.


The ""nwcomteminal_data"" table
This table included the also included the machine IP address, MAC address, host name, and which Windows KB/patches had been applied.


The ""dhcp_data"" table
This table included the asset tag for a device and the MAC address. The ""EA-LastModifiedBy"" field included usernames of what I can presume to be administrative staff who made changes.


The ""printer_data""  table
This table included the printer name and internal IP. Roughly 2,500 rows of data per update.


The endpoint security table
I am specifically not sharing the real name of this table as it makes it clear who the endpoint security vendor is. This table included the username of the employee and the endpoint security status for their machine. Roughly 90,000 rows of data per update.


The ""uncontrolledmachine"" table
This table included what I can reasonably guess (I cannot 100% confirm) to be the hostname and operating system for machines that are not monitored by the endpoint security software. Some usernames were also present. Roughly 3,000 rows of data per update.


This isn't a separate table in the database, but this is a selection of columns from the ""ad_com_all"" table showing the wealth of useful data for an attacker. This view shows the hostname, username, last login date, when created, last changed date, OS, OS version.


The CEO's laptop
This view shows the CEO's full email, full name, department, MAC address, which Windows KB/patches had been applied, OS, OS version, endpoint security status, IP, and device type.


This view shows the CEO's full name, last login date, employee ID, email, department, email nickname, and account name.


Summary
Thank you to Honda for quickly acting on my report and securing this data.

Please secure your data.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,25.31999969482422,23.65999984741211,26.07999992370605,27.420000076293945,28.1200008392334,28.270000457763672,26.40999984741211,25.65999984741211,23.40999984741211,24.04999923706055,26.04999923706055,25.559999465942386,25.309999465942386,27.633000000000003,27.633000000000003

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) announced today that on July 19, 2019, it determined there was unauthorized access by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for its credit card products and to Capital One credit card customers.

Capital One immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that this individual exploited and promptly began working with federal law enforcement. The FBI has arrested the person responsible. Based on our analysis to date, we believe it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual. However, we will continue to investigate.


""While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened,"" said Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and CEO. ""I sincerely apologize for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right.""

Based on our analysis to date, this event affected approximately 100 million individuals in the United States and approximately 6 million in Canada.

Importantly, no credit card account numbers or log-in credentials were compromised and over 99 percent of Social Security numbers were not compromised.

The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019. This information included personal information Capital One routinely collects at the time it receives credit card applications, including names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income.

Beyond the credit card application data, the individual also obtained portions of credit card customer data, including:

Customer status data, e.g., credit scores, credit limits, balances, payment history, contact information
Fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, 2017 and 2018
No bank account numbers or Social Security numbers were compromised, other than:

About 140,000 Social Security numbers of our credit card customers
About 80,000 linked bank account numbers of our secured credit card customers
For our Canadian credit card customers, approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers were compromised in this incident.

We will notify affected individuals through a variety of channels. We will make free credit monitoring and identity protection available to everyone affected.

Safeguarding applicant and customer information is essential to our mission and our role as a financial institution. We have invested heavily in cybersecurity and will continue to do so. We will incorporate the learnings from this incident to further strengthen our cyber defenses.

On July 29, 2019, we announced that on July 19, 2019, we determined there was unauthorized access by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers (the “Cybersecurity Incident”). The Cybersecurity Incident occurred on March 22 and 23, 2019. We believe that a highly sophisticated individual was able to exploit a specific configuration vulnerability in our infrastructure. The configuration vulnerability was reported to us by an external security researcher on July 17, 2019. We then began our own internal investigation, leading to the July 19, 2019, determination that the Cybersecurity Incident occurred. We immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that this individual exploited and verified there are no other instances in our environment. Among other things, we also augmented our routine automated scanning to look for this issue on a continuous basis. We promptly began working with federal law enforcement. The person responsible was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on July 29, 2019 and federal prosecution of the responsible person commenced.
Based on our analysis to date, we believe it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual. However, we will continue to investigate. Based on our analysis to date, this event affected approximately 100 million individuals in the United States and approximately 6 million in Canada. We believe no credit card account numbers or log-in credentials were compromised. The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019. This information included personal information that we routinely collect at the time we receive credit card applications, including names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income. In addition to credit card application data, the individual also obtained portions of credit card customer data, including customer status data (e.g., credit scores, credit limits, balances, payment history, contact information) and fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, 2017 and 2018. Approximately 140,000 Social Security numbers of our credit card customers and approximately 80,000 linked bank account numbers of our secured credit card customers were compromised in this incident. For our Canadian credit card customers, approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers were compromised in this incident. Our assessment of the incident is ongoing and analysis is subject to change.
We expect to notify affected individuals through a variety of channels and make free credit monitoring and identity protection available to everyone affected. We have retained a leading independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a comprehensive assessment to confirm the scope of the access and the specific data impacted.
We expect the Cybersecurity Incident to generate incremental costs of approximately $100 to $150 million in 2019. Expected costs are largely driven by customer notifications, credit monitoring, technology costs, and professional support relating to the remediation of and response to the Cybersecurity Incident. We expect to accrue the costs for customer notification and credit monitoring in 2019. The expected incremental costs related to the incident will be separately reported as an adjusting item as it relates to our financial results. In addition to the adjusting item in 2019, we expect any incremental investments in cybersecurity to be funded within our current budget. We carry insurance to cover certain costs associated with a cyber risk event. This insurance is subject to a $10 million deductible and standard exclusions and carries a total coverage limit of $400 million. The timing of recognition of costs may differ from the timing of recognition of any insurance reimbursement. Insurance recoveries associated with the incident will also be treated as an adjusting item as it relates to our financial results.
The ultimate magnitude of any expenses or any other impact to our business or reputation may be significant and some of our expenses may not be covered by insurance. However, we do not believe that this incident will impact our strategy or long-term financial health.

“We recently learned of unauthorized access to our computer network on or around June 1, 2019,” according to the July 22 letter. ″As a result we believe some personal information of some of our online banking customers may have been improperly viewed or acquired.”

The letter did not disclose how many customers were affected. But James Abbott, director of external communications, said information from “a limited number"" of customers ""may have been viewed or accessed by an unauthorized user of our data network.”


User names, email addresses, account numbers — as well as Social Security or tax numbers if used as identification — were included in the accessed information.

“Passwords,"" the letter emphasized, “were not included in the data that may have been accessed.”

After it learned of the breach, Zions contacted forensic experts to determine the scope of the intrusion. Federal law enforcement and banking regulators also were notified.

“We quickly took measures to enhance customer security,” the letter states, ""and are implementing enhanced internal monitoring on accounts designed to protect them from illicit actions.”

The bank currently has no evidence that “personal information has been misused.”

Regulation FD

On July 1, 2019, Innospec Inc. (“Innospec or the “Company”) disclosed that it has been subject to a malicious network security incident.

The Company continues to manufacture and dispatch product. At this time, there is no evidence that data relating to customers or suppliers has been taken. The Company is conducting an investigation into this matter, and that investigation remains ongoing.

The Company is taking steps to restore its network and as part of this process has temporarily suspended some of its systems, including email. The Company is working as quickly as possible to minimize any potential disruption.

The incident began on approximately Thursday, June 27, 2019, and the Company immediately responded by working to remedy the issue. The Company has notified law enforcement.

The Company believes the safety of its manufacturing operations has not been compromised by the incident, or by the response.

As appropriate, the Company will continue to communicate when it has further information.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1054905/000119312519186702/d772115d8k.htm,2019-07-01 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1054905/000119312519214188/0001193125-19-214188-index.htm,Risk Factors | MDA | Footnotes | ICFR,2019-08-06 00:00:00,"Network Security Incident
On June 27, 2019 we experienced a network security incident that prevented access to certain information technology systems and data within our network. The Company took prompt action designed to contain the incident and implemented our business continuity plan. We are working closely with external cybersecurity experts to restore any remaining affected information technology systems. The matter was reported to U.S. law enforcement authorities and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom.

Table of Contents
 
Since the time of the network security incident, our manufacturing processes, which rely on separate networks, have continued to operate safely, largely without interruption, and in compliance with all environmental regulations. The security incident primarily impacted our computer access, email, as well as our computing functions which included: order entry, shipping and receiving, vendor payments, production scheduling, and other systems. These are now either restored or being processed manually, thereby providing business continuity, although resulting in certain delays in sales execution.
We have also taken additional precautionary measures to ensure the continued safe operations of our sites. We have found no evidence that any customer, supplier or employee information was accessed or extracted during the incident, or that any customer or supplier systems or data outside our network have been impacted. 
We are still assessing the full financial impact of the incident, including in relation to responsive insurance coverages that may be available, but we believe it has not materially impacted the results for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Although we expect to incur material future costs, we believe the vast majority will be covered by insurance policies and therefore will have minimal overall net impact on future results. Future orders may be impacted, as we manage production scheduling and shipping, potentially causing delays in order fulfilment. Any delays in order fulfilment or other impacts from this incident may result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A credential stuffing attack is when attackers compile username and passwords that were leaked from previous security breaches and use those credentials to try and gain access to other sites.


With new reports of data breaches or leaks coming out almost every day and people using the same password at every site they create an account, TripAdvisor's policy is a good one as it only protects their members.

So if you receive this email, do not be worried and just reset your TripAdvisor password at https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberForgotPassword if you wish to login to the site again.

The email TripAdvisor sends out when it encounters one of their members using the same credentials that were found in a leaked data breach or leak, can can be read in its entirety below:

Dear TripAdvisor Traveler,
 
As part of our ongoing efforts to protect your security, TripAdvisor recently compared our member databases with lists of publicly leaked passwords. Unfortunately, your email and password were included on a list of leaked passwords. As a result, to protect your TripAdvisor account we have invalidated your password.
  
We recommend that you create a strong password that includes:

 * A unique combination of words, numbers, symbols, and both upper- and lower-case letters 
 * A minimum of eight (8) characters 
 * No commonly used words
 
Please visit the following page to create a new password for your account:
 
https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberForgotPassword
 
In addition, we recommend that you take additional steps for the safety of your other online accounts. If your discontinued TripAdvisor password is used on any other site or app, change your password on those sites/apps — and avoid using any password on more than one site.

Dan Salmon said he scraped the transactions during a cumulative six months to raise awareness and warn users to set their Venmo payments to private.

The peer-to-peer mobile payments service faced criticism last year after Hang Do Thi Duc, a former Mozilla fellow, downloaded 207 million transactions. The scraping effort was possible because Venmo payments between users are public by default. The scrapable data inspired several new projects — including a bot that tweeted out every time someone bought drugs.

A year on, Salmon showed little has changed and that it’s still easy to download millions of transactions through the company’s developer API without obtaining user permission or needing the app.

Using that data, anyone can look at an entire user’s public transaction history, who they shared money with, when, and in some cases for what reason — including illicit goods and substances.

“There’s truly no reason to have this API open to unauthenticated requests,” he told TechCrunch. “The API only exists to provide like a scrolling feed of public transactions for the home page of the app, but if that’s your goal then you should require a token with each request to verify that the user is logged in.”

He published the scraped data on his GitHub page.

Venmo  has done little to curb the privacy issue for its 40 million users since the scraping effort blew up a year ago. Venmo reacted by changing its privacy guide and, and later updated its app to remove a warning when users went to change their default privacy settings from public to private.


How to change your Venmo privacy settings.


Instead, Venmo has focused its effort on making the data more difficult to scrape rather than the underlying privacy issues.

When Dan Gorelick first sounded the alarm on Venmo’s public data in 2016, few limits on the API meant anyone could scrape data in bulk and at speed. Other researchers like Johnny Xmas  have since said that Venmo restricted its API to limit what historical data can be collected. But Venmo’s most recent limits still allowed Salmon to spit out 40 transactions per minute. That amounts to about 57,600 scraped transactions each day, he said.

Last year, PayPal  — which owns Venmo — settled with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy and security violations. The company was criticized for misleading users over its privacy settings. The FTC said users weren’t properly informed that some transactions would be shared publicly, and that Venmo misrepresented the app’s security by saying it was “bank-grade,” which the FTC disputed.

(WAVE) - Evite recently became aware of a data security breach involving customer information. 
Evite is a website that allows users to create and send online invitations. 
It became aware of the incident on April 15 and immediately brought in a leading data security firm to launch an investigation, the company said. The investigation found malicious activity starting on Feb. 22. 
On May 14, the investigation found that an unauthorized party acquired a file associated with Evite user accounts. The data file is inactive, storing old user data no more recent than 2013. 

Information in the file included names, usernames, email addresses, Evite passwords, and, if provided by the user, date of birth, phone numbers and mailing addresses.
The company has no evidence that personal information has been misused. 
Evite is now working with computer experts to enhance its security. It will also continue to watch for unauthorized access and introduce additional security measures.

All Evite users will be forced to reset their passwords the next time they log-in. 

Law enforcement has been contacted regarding the incident. 
Users are recommended to take the following steps: 
Change your password for any other account on which you used the same or similar password used for your Evite account.
Review your accounts for suspicious activity.
Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a website asking for personal information.
Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails.

Thank you for being an eCompli user. Avalara, Inc., recently purchased the eCompli software application from a
company called Compli, Inc. We are contacting you because we recently learned about a vulnerability in eCompli
that resulted in the accidental exposure to a third party of certain personal information that you provided to us.
The third party informed us of the vulnerability after discovering it, and subsequently deleted all copies of
personal information that they accessed via the vulnerability. The third party also certified that they did not use or
share the personal information for any purpose other than as described in this notice. We have taken appropriate
steps to address and remove the vulnerability, and our investigation indicated that this third party was the only
party that accessed the personal information via the vulnerability.
WHAT HAPPENED
On May 22, 2019, an employee of one of our customers (who happens to be a former employee of Compli, Inc.)
notified us that an eCompli code update contained a vulnerability that allowed the employee to gain unauthorized
access to certain personal information about certain individuals at some of our customers, including your
organization. This third party informed us of the vulnerability and we subsequently removed the vulnerability on
May 22, 2019.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED
The types of personal information that were exposed included users’ first and last names, organization, social
security number, driver’s license number and state, contact information, date and place of birth, citizenship status,
eye and hair color, weight, height, marital status, marriage date and place, employment history, residence history
and State Alcohol Board license number and date of expiration. The third party that discovered the vulnerability
informed us of the vulnerability and subsequently certified to us that they did not share with any other party, and
deleted all copies of, the information they accessed via the vulnerability. We have also confirmed by reviewing
our internal logs that this third party was the only entity who accessed personal information via the vulnerability.
WHAT WE ARE DOING
In response to the notification from this third party, we promptly conducted an investigation to determine the
scope of the incident, confirmed that the vulnerability was removed on May 22, 2019, and took all reasonable and
appropriate actions to ensure that the security and integrity of our platform has been restored. We and our service
providers have reviewed our security protocols and taken steps to address the security of the platform. We and our
service providers are closely monitoring our platform to help protect against future unauthorized access.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
In addition to reviewing the items discussed below, we encourage you to remain vigilant about any suspicious
activity involving your personal information.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Please consider the following additional information:

 You may wish to visit the website of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission at
http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft or reach the FTC at 877-382-4357 or 600
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580 for further information about how to protect yourself
from identity theft. Your state Attorney General may also have advice on preventing identity theft, and you
should report instances of known or suspected identity theft to law enforcement, your State Attorney General,
and the FTC.
 You may have the right to obtain any police report filed related to this intrusion, and to file a police report and
obtain a copy of it if you are the victim of identity theft.
 U.S. residents are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit
bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free 877-322-8228.
 You can request information regarding “fraud alerts” and “security freezes” from the three major U.S. credit
bureaus listed below. At no charge, if you are a U.S. resident, you can have these credit bureaus place a “fraud
alert” on your file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in
your name. This service can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. Note, however,
that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it also may delay your ability to
obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert,
the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. A “security freeze” generally prohibits the credit
reporting agency from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your written
authorization. You should be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit account may delay or
interfere with the timely approval of any requests that you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, or other
services. Unlike fraud alerts, to obtain a security freeze you must send a written request to each of the three
major reporting agencies and you may be required to provide information such as your: (1) name; (2) Social
Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address; (5) addresses over the past five years; (6) proof of
current address; (7) copy of government identification; and (8) any police/investigative report or complaint.
Should you wish to place a fraud alert or a security freeze, or should you have any questions regarding your
credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.

What Happened?
Mediant Communications Inc. (""Mediant"") is a third-party service provider that distributes proxy materials
and records voting results for shareholder meetings on behalf of Jackson. Mediant received your personal
information from Jackson to prepare and process proxy materials to be mailed to you.
On April 1, 2019, an unknown malicious party may have obtained unauthorized access to certain Mediant
business email accounts containing your personal information. On that same day, following the discovery of the
unauthorized access, Mediant disconnected the affected email server from its system and began an investigation to
understand the nature and scope of the incident. During this investigation, Mediant learned that information used
to mail proxy materials to certain Jackson policy holders was among the information potentially impacted. On May
21, 2019, based upon information provided by Mediant, Jackson was able to determine the scope of the breach,
including the contract number and residence state of all affected individuals.
What Information Was Involved?
The following personal information may have been involved in the incident: your full name, address,
contract number, owner/annuitant designation, issue date of the policy, gender, sub-account fund identification
number, fund units owned, whether individuals signed up for e-delivery for the prospectus, and email address (only
for those individuals signed up for e-delivery).
What We Are Doing. 
We are taking this incident very seriously. We have taken steps to be sure that Mediant strengthens the
protection of personal information by updating its network security controls and email system. We will continue to
closely monitor and take further steps as appropriate to safeguard your personal information. Mediant has reported
the matter to law enforcement, but this notice has not been delayed because of law enforcement investigation.
In addition, we are offering credit monitoring for a period of 24 months at no cost to you. To take advantage
of this offer:
• Ensure that you enroll by: [enrollment end date] (Your code will not work after this date.)
• Visit the Experian IdentityWorks website to enroll: www.experianidworks.com/credit

identity restoration services by Experian. If you have more than one contract impacted, you will receive individual
letters for each contract and need only enroll one time.
What You Can Do.
It is always a good practice to be vigilant and closely review or monitor your financial accounts, statements,
credit reports and other financial information for any evidence of unusual activity, fraudulent charges or signs of
identity theft. In addition, because the malicious third-party may have obtained your email address, please be
particularly vigilant for emails that attempt to get you to provide personal information in response or otherwise
seem suspicious. Additionally, changing your password and security questions and enrolling in dual-factor

The website Krebs on Security reported late Friday that security flaws in First American’s website had exposed digitized documents related to mortgage deals dating back to 2003. The documents included everything from bank account numbers and statements to tax records and Social Security numbers. 

All the documents were available to anyone with a browser who had a link to a single document at the website, by replacing one digit in the link at a time—the files were numbered in order. No log-in or password information was needed. A real estate developer reportedly contacted Krebs on Security after discovering the problem.

First American says it immediately shut down external access to the application when it found out about the problem. But it remains unclear whether any cybercriminals noticed the flaw and used it to steal consumer information before the problem was addressed.

Security and risk management experts say the leak is an example of how even large companies often neglect to bake security into the design of their online services.

“This is Web Application Security 101,” says Michael Covington, a vice president at Wandera, a mobile security company. “With all we’ve seen in breaches over the last few years, this isn’t something you’d expect from a company like First American.”

“Security was clearly not part of the design picture for them,” adds Nick Sanna, CEO of cybersecurity risk management firm RiskLens.

Consumer advocates agree. “We already knew companies are not sufficiently incentivized to protect sensitive consumer data,” says Katie McInnis, policy council at Consumer Reports. “But the leak of hundreds of millions of title insurance records by First American is egregious.” 

When contacted for comment by CR, First American directed us to a statement confirming what it called a “design defect” that “made possible unauthorized access to customer data.” The company also said that it is “currently evaluating what effect, if any, this had on the security of customer information.”

The company also noted that it has hired an outside forensic firm to determine whether there has been any “meaningful unauthorized access to our customer data.”

The details surrounding exactly what happened are still emerging, but here’s what we know so far. 

What data was included? According to Krebs on Security, the records included about 885 million files covering bank account numbers and statements, mortgage and tax records, Social Security numbers, wire transaction receipts, and driver’s license images. First American didn’t confirm the 885 million estimate in its statement.

Was this a data breach? Technically, no. This wasn’t the work of hackers. Instead, it was a very badly designed web application. In theory, anyone could have accessed the information, Covington says.  

Is there any way to tell whether cybercriminals accessed the records? If First American has audit records in place, Covington says, security professionals will be able to see which files were accessed and whether an actual attacker has combed through them or mostly just the people who discovered the problem.

What can I do to protect myself? First American has yet to offer any way for consumers to determine whether their personal information has been compromised. But there is precedent for doing that: Equifax set up a website to help people learn whether they’d been part of its massive data breach in 2017, for example.
Sanna and Covington both say they expect the company to offer free credit monitoring. In the meantime, Consumer Reports experts say that because of the many data breaches and leaks of recent years, you may also want to freeze your credit at the major credit bureaus. This will prevent criminals from taking out loans or establishing credit cards using your name and other personal data, and you can do it free of charge.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1472787/000156459019020528/0001564590-19-020528-index.htm,2019-05-28 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1472787/000156459019026030/0001564590-19-026030-index.htm,Risk Factors | MDA,2019-07-25 00:00:00,"In fact, during the third quarter of 2019, the Company concluded an investigation regarding potential unauthorized access to non-public personal information as a result of a vulnerability in one of the Company's applications.

These 32 consumers have been notified and offered complimentary credit monitoring services.

This time around, security researcher Anurag Sen discovered a public Amazon Web Services (AWS) database containing the contact information of more than 49 million Instagram accounts, TechCrunch reports. For those out of the loop, Facebook is the monopolistic owner of Instagram and most other things social media.

Details of the Instagram Data Leak
The exposed database includes public information from Instagram accounts such as the number of followers, likes, and shares of a particular user. More concerning, though, is the inclusion of email addresses and phone numbers of numerous account owners – information that Instagram allegedly keeps private.

Chtrbox, a social media marketing firm, owns the database. As part of the data, the company calculated a net worth for each account using public information and presumably reached out with offers through the suspiciously obtained contact information.

Facebook has had little to say on the matter, telling TechCrunch:

“We’re looking into the issue to understand if the data described – including email and phone numbers – was from Instagram or from other sources.”

46 0 Days Since Facebook’s Last Privacy Accident
This latest Instagram snafu further proves that Facebook either doesn’t care or doesn’t know how to secure user privacy.

The security vulnerability affects both iPhone and Android devices, with malicious code (allegedly) from Israel's NSO Group, transmitted whether or not a user answers an infected call.

Facebook has suffered a multitude of security and privacy breaches in the last year, but this news that a government-grade intelligence collection application had targeted the company's WhatsApp application is different. WhatsApp is Facebook's flagship messaging application and is lauded for its end-to-end encryption, both for messaging and voice calls. As a result, it has become a standard communications platform for government and security officials in many countries around the world.

WhatsApp told the Financial Times, which broke the story, that ""the attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems. We have briefed a number of human rights organizations to share the information we can, and to work with them to notify civil society.""
WhatsApp engineers had been working round the clock to close the security loophole that was discovered early this month, and the company started to deploy a fix to servers on Friday and to customers on Monday. According to the Financial Times, a WhatsApp spokesperson said ""a number in the dozens would not be inaccurate"" in terms of impacted users.

The WhatsApp vulnerability is a buffer overflow weakness, enabling malicious code to be inserted into data packets sent during the process of starting a voice call. When the data is received, WhatsApp's internal buffer is forced to overflow, overwriting other parts of the app's memory, and control is given over to the application.


Or as Facebook somewhat drily said: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP packets sent to a target phone number. The issue affects WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.19.134, WhatsApp Business for Android prior to v2.19.44, WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.19.51, WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to v2.19.51, WhatsApp for Windows Phone prior to v2.18.348, and WhatsApp for Tizen prior to v2.18.15.""

Ironically, on Monday Amnesty International said that it was ""supporting legal action to take the Israeli Ministry of Defence (MoD) to court, to demand that it revokes the export license of NSO Group, an Israeli company whose spyware products have been used in chilling attacks on human rights defenders around the world. In a petition to be filed tomorrow at the District Court of Tel Aviv, approximately 30 members and supporters of Amnesty International Israel and others from the human rights community set out how the MoD has put human rights at risk by allowing NSO to continue exporting its products.""

""NSO Group sells its products to governments who are known for outrageous human rights abuses, giving them the tools to track activists and critics,"" said Amnesty's Danna Ingleton. In August 2018, an Amnesty staff member was targeted by NSO's Pegasus, software that has also been linked to attacks in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. ""The attack on Amnesty International was the final straw,"" Ingleton added.

NSO's Pegasus software is intended for use by governments as a collection tool, enabling over the air access to devices. The software can target the microphone, camera and location data from a device, and has been described as the most sophisticated smartphone hack of all times. The fact that the Israeli company has been accused of selling the technology to countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE is clearly interesting given the geopolitical context.

NSO told the newspaper that it ""vetted customers and investigated abuse"". Asked about the WhatsApp news, NSO said it was ""investigating"" and that ""under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. NSO would not, or could not, use its technology in its own right to target any person or organization.""

Whether this impacts the trust in the security of the WhatsApp application across its 1.5 billion users we are about to find out. It is unlikely. Albeit, again, the likes of Signal and Telegram will be major beneficiaries of this news, especially amongst groups of users where communications security is critical.

In a statement, WhatsApp said ""we encourage people to upgrade to the latest version of our app, as well as keep their mobile operating system up to date, to protect against potential targeted exploits designed to compromise information stored on mobile devices.""

In late February/early March, we were the target of an external cyber-attack. Upon discovery of the cyber-attack, we took immediate action to remediate the security vulnerability and retained a cybersecurity firm to evaluate our systems and identify solutions based on the evolving circumstances. The threat actors gained unauthorized access to, and encrypted,  certain of our information technology systems and databases. To date, there is no evidence of mass exfiltration of the information. The attack caused some initial disruption to our ability to traffic radio advertising spots, which was quickly remediated, and we have incurred expenses in responding to the incident, rebuilding back-office systems and upgrading hardware and software.
 
In an abundance of caution, we have provided notice to all potentially impacted parties and have provided credit monitoring and identity protection services to those who may have been affected by this cyber-attack. We continue to implement security enhancements since this incident. We have incurred expenses subsequent to the cyber-attack to investigate and remediate this matter and expect to continue to incur expenses of this nature in the foreseeable future.

We represent Berry Global, Inc. (""BGI""), a global manufacturer of plastic packaging products,
headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, with respect to a potential data security incident described in more
detail below. BGI takes the security and privacy of the information in its control very seriously, and has
taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.
In late January, 2019, an unauthorized individual sent several BGI employees phishing emails,
which resulted in the individual accessing the contents of those email accounts. BGI immediately took
action, securing the email accounts, and conducted an investigation to determine what information was
at risk of compromise. However, during the time that the individual had access to the account it is
possible, though it cannot be confirmed, that the contents of the mailbox may have been viewed or
downloaded.
BGI analyzed the contents of all of the impacted mailboxes, and on April 4, 2019, discovered
that one or more of the mailboxes contained messages or attachments that included individuals'
personal information. BGI has no reason to believe anyone's information was used for any inappropriate
purpose. The personal information that may have been accessed includes individuals' names, and may
include one or more of the following data elements: address, Social Security number, date of birth,
driver license, financial account information, and limited health information, if provided.
Three (3) Maryland residents may have been affected by this incident. Notification letters to
these individuals were mailed by first class mail, on May 09, 2019. A sample copy of the notification
letter is included with this letter.
BGI takes the security of all information in its systems very seriously, and wants to assure you
that it is taking steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Those steps include
requiring all employees to reset their passwords to ensure any unauthorized access had been
terminated. BGI is also adopting additional security practices to help prevent a similar incident from
occurring in the future, including the implementation of technical security measures and the retraining
and reeducation of its workforce. 
BGI remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control. If you have any
questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Very truly yours,
Kevin M. Scott

On Tuesday, cybersecurity researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar from vpnMentor said they were able to access a database belonging to Canada's fourth-largest telco, which was ""totally unprotected and unencrypted.""

The database contained the email addresses of customers, phone and mobile numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, customer types, and IP addresses linked to payment methods.

In addition, the researchers say that unencrypted financial data was exposed, including credit numbers and security codes (CVV numbers), alongside credit score responses from Equifax and other credit monitoring services.

Freedom Mobile account numbers, subscription dates, billing cycle dates, and customer service records could also be accessed.

""These records seem to reflect any action taken within a user account, allowing for multiple entries per customer,"" the researchers say.

The leak was discovered on April 17, 2019. After attempting to contact the telecommunications giant multiple times, Rotem and Locar received a response on April 24 and the leak was plugged on the same day.

VpnMentor's researchers say that up to 1.5 million active Freedom Mobile users may have been impacted by the breach and they had full access to over five million records -- but as an ethical sticking point the team did not download the database, and so it is not known exactly how many individuals were involved.

Calgary-based Freedom Mobile has hit back against this estimate and claims that the 1.5 million figure is ""inaccurate."" Instead, the telco says that only 15,000 customers were affected.

The company claims that customers at 17 retail stores who recently opened or changed account information were involved, according to the Globe and Mail, and the incident occurred due to a new third-party company, Apptium Technologies, which was recently brought in to streamline retail systems.

Freedom Mobile said that there is no evidence that the leaked data has been abused, nor have the firm's internal systems been compromised in any way.

This is not the only high-profile data breach which has been disclosed this week. In related news, Binance, one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms worldwide, revealed a ""large-scale security breach"" which has led to the theft of over 7,000 Bitcoin (BTC), which equates to roughly $41 million. Binance intends to absorb the theft so customers are not impacted.

The issue was detailed by Security Discovery on May 3, a couple days after the publicly accessible MongoDB instance was discovered. According to a post by Diachenko, the database appeared to house data related to Shudder and Sundance NOW, both of which are premium AMC Networks services.

More than 1.6 million records had some subscriber data related to both services, including subscription status, when the subscription was started and cancelled, and the users’ country, names, and email addresses. As well, there were more than 3,300 links to Stripe invoices that reportedly contained users’ names, email addresses, and the last four digital of their credit card numbers.

The database reportedly also contained some other info, including users’ city/state/zip codes, details on the streaming devices they used, their IP addresses, and some unspecified metadata. There were also links that led to ‘internal catalogue data and other metadata info,’ according to the Security Discovery post.

Diachenko detailed some issues with contacting AMC about the exposed data, saying in this post, “…it was almost impossible to employ a responsible disclosure procedure here, since all emails and contacts related to privacy and security were bouncing back.” AMC was eventually contacted through a third party on Diachenko’s behalf and the database was taken down.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,57.36000061035156,54.38000106811523,55.06000137329102,53.18000030517578,46.7400016784668,47.93999862670898,43.08000183105469,37.47000122070313,39.150001525878906,36.560001373291016,31.06999969482422,22.299999237060547,24.040000915527344,52.0,52.0

On April 30, 2019, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (the “Company” or “Registrant”) notified clients of unauthorized access into portions of its information systems.  Promptly upon detection of unusual activity in its information systems in mid-March, the Company commenced an investigation into this incident, coordinated with U.S. federal law enforcement, and engaged leading cybersecurity experts.  Charles River also began to promptly implement a comprehensive containment and remediation plan.  

While the investigation is ongoing, the Company has recently determined that some client data was copied by a highly sophisticated, well-resourced intruder.  The number of clients whose data is known to have been copied represents approximately 1% of Charles River’s total number of clients.  The percentage of clients affected does not necessarily equate to the potential revenue or financial impact related to this incident, which the Company has yet to determine.  There is no indication at this time that any of the client data the Company has identified as having been accessed during this incident was deleted, corrupted, or altered. Charles River has taken steps to contact all clients whose data is known to have been copied.

The Company continues to move aggressively to further secure its information systems, which includes adding enhanced security features and monitoring procedures to further protect its client data. While Charles River has taken substantial steps to minimize unauthorized access into its information systems, until its ongoing remediation process is complete, the Company will be unable to determine that this incident has been entirely remediated. However, Charles River believes it has closed the point of entry employed by the intruder in connection with this incident.

While most of the information is publicly available, the databases contain the email addresses of the LinkedIn users.

Approximately two weeks ago, I was contacted by security researcher Sanyam Jain of the GDI foundation about something strange that he was seeing. Jain told BleepingComputer that he kept seeing unsecured databases containing the same LinkedIn data appearing and disappearing from the Internet under different IP addresses.

""According to my analysis the data has been removed every day and loaded on another IP. After some time the database becomes either inaccessible or I can no longer connect to the particular IP, which makes me think it was secured. It is very strange.""

 
 

SKIP AD

Between all eight databases, there was a combined total of approximately 60 million records that contained what appeared to be scraped public information of LinkedIn users. The total size of all of the 8 DBs is 229 GB, with each database ranging between 25 GB to 32 GB. 

Example Database
Example Database
As a test, Jain pulled my record from one of the databases and sent it to me for review. The data contained in this record included my LinkedIn profile information, including IDs, profile URLs, work history, education history, location, listed skills, other social profiles, and the last time the profile was updated.

Included in the profile was also my email address that I used when registering my LinkedIn account. It is not known how they gained access to this information as I have always had the LinkedIn privacy setting configured to not publicly display my email address.

Profile information for my record
Profile information for my record
After reviewing the data that was sent to me, I found all of the information to be accurate.

In addition to the above public information, each profile also contains what appears to be internal values that describe the type of LinkedIn subscription the user has and whether they utilize a particular email provider. These values are labeled ""isProfessional"", ""isPersonal"", ""isGmail"", ""isHotmail"", and ""isOutlook"".

Internal Values
Internal Values
While we not able to determine who the database belonged to, we were able to contact Amazon who is hosting the databases for assistance in getting them secured. As of Monday, the databases were secured and are no longer accessible via the Internet.

LinkedIn states it's not their database
After seeing that the database contained a user's email addresses and what appeared to be possible internal values, BleepingComputer contacted LinkedIn to see if the database belonged to them.

After they reviewed my sample record, Paul Rockwell, head of Trust & Safety at LinkedIn, told us that this database does not belong to them, but they are aware of third-party databases containing scraped LinkedIn data.


""We are aware of claims of a scraped LinkedIn database. Our investigation indicates that a third-party company exposed a set of data aggregated from LinkedIn public profiles as well as other, non-LinkedIn sources. We have no indication that LinkedIn has been breached.""

When we followed up with questions as to why the databases would contain my email, we were told that in some cases an email address could be public and were provided a link to a privacy page that allows you to configure who can see a profile's email address.

The site reported the Bengaluru-headquartered IT services company was ‘dealing with a multi-month intrusion from an assumed state-sponsored attacker’ and that Wipro’s systems were seen being used to attack at least a dozen of its clients.

“We detected a potentially abnormal activity in a few employee accounts on our network due to an advanced phishing campaign. Upon learning of the incident, we promptly began an investigation, identified the affected users and took remedial steps to contain and mitigate any potential impact,” Wipro Ltd said in a statement to ET.

KrebsOnSecurity had reported that Wipro was in the process of building a ‘new private email network’ because the intruders were believed to have compromised Wipro’s corporate email system.

“We are leveraging our industry-leading cyber security practices and collaborating with our partner ecosystem to collect and monitor advanced threat intelligence for enhancing security posture. We have also retained a well-respected, independent forensic firm to assist us in the investigation. We continue to monitor our enterprise and infrastructure at a heightened level of alertness,” the Wipro statement added. The company is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings today.

According to Microsoft, between January 1, 2019, and March 29, 2019, a hacker, or group of hackers, compromised the account of a Microsoft support agent, one of the company's customer support representatives that handles technical complaints.

The OS maker said it disabled the compromised support agent's credentials once it learned of the unauthorized intrusion; however, the company said there might be a possibility that the hacker accessed and viewed the content of some Outlook users' accounts.

""This unauthorized access could have allowed unauthorized parties to access and/or view information related to your email account (such as your e-mail address, folder names, the subject lines of e-mails, and the names of other e-mail addresses you communicate with), but not the content of any e-mails or attachments,"" Microsoft said in the email sent to customers.

However, former Microsoft engineers have contested this claim --that support agents can't view user's email content.

""They can see how many emails you have, where the database lies, email content, last person you emailed,"" one former engineer told ZDNet via encrypted chat.

Contacted by ZDNet, Microsoft confirmed that hackers did access the content of some user accounts. The company put the number at around six percent of the people who received an email notification.


Those users received ""additional guidance and support,"" Microsoft said.

In the meantime, the company is recommending that users who received the email about this recent breach change their Outlook.com credentials, ""out of caution,"" even if hackers did not access Outlook users' passwords.

ZDNet understands that the incident only affected a small number of Microsoft Outlook users and that Microsoft has also increased detection and monitoring for the affected accounts, just to be sure there's no unauthorized access for those accounts.

Dear Sir or Madam:
We write to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of personal information relating
to two (2) Maryland residents. Corning’s investigation into this event is ongoing and this notice will be
supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this
notice, Corning does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the
applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.
Nature of the Data Event
On March 12, 2019, Corning learned that on or about January 29, 2019, at least one dormant email
account of an employee of an entity acquired by Corning was “spoofed” and was thereafter accessible
by, and initiated later emails on behalf of, an unauthorized third party. That email account contained
personally identifiable information provided to Corning by employees in connection with their
employment. Although Corning has no evidence to suggest that private information was misused, the
possibility that emails and/or attachments in the account were viewed by the unauthorized party could
not be ruled out.
Corning takes data privacy and this incident very seriously. Immediately upon becoming aware of the
incident, Corning took steps to block access to the account by resetting passwords and hired a leading
forensics firm to help investigate. Through that investigation and following an extensive programmatic
and manual review of the emails and attachments, Corning determined that an unauthorized party had
access to records which may have included employee names, addresses, email addresses, and Social
Security numbers.
Notice to Maryland Residents
On or about April 12, 2019, Corning mailed written notice of this incident to two (2) Maryland residents
affected in the incident, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto and labeled as
Exhibit A.
Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Upon discovering this incident, Corning immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature
and scope of the event, as well as whose data may potentially be affected. Corning is mailing written
notice to affected consumers and certain regulators. This notice includes guidance on how to better
protect against identity theft and fraud, how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit
file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a
free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing
account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal
Trade Commission and the Maryland Attorney General, for additional information on steps to take to
avoid identity theft. As an added precaution, Corning arranged to have Experian provide the affected
individuals twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services at no cost to the
individual. Corning is also providing notice of this event to other state and federal regulators as
appropriate.
Corning has taken steps to ensure the security of the information it stores. As part of its ongoing efforts
to help prevent another incident from occurring in the future, it is re-educating employees on cyber best
practices and enhancing existing security measures by implementing two-factor authentication for
remote email access to these accounts. Corning also implemented a forced password reset protocol
across all affected systems, has removed all outside access to the accounts at issue, and subscribes to an
email security program for inbound and outbound filtering and blocking of emails potentially containing
personally identifiable information.

Based upon an extensive forensic investigation, it appears that an unauthorized individual was able to gain access to and install malicious software designed to capture payment card information on some of our payment processing systems at a limited number of our locations. Although we do not store payment card information on our systems, based on the forensic investigation, it appears that the malicious software was able to capture card information data in real time as card information was being entered into our systems. To find out if your Pie Five location was impacted, please visit www.piefivepizza.com/paymentcardsecurity for a list of affected locations. Please note that this incident did not affect any purchases made on www.piefivepizza.com.


What Information Was Involved?
Based on our investigation to date, we believe the malicious software could have affected payment card data – including name, payment card account number, card expiration date, and card verification code – of some customers who used a payment card at affected Pie Five locations. The incident did not affect Social Security numbers, customer addresses, or any other sensitive personal information. Although not all transactions were affected, the forensic investigation has indicated that this incident may have impacted certain individuals who made payment card purchases between September 6, 2018, and December 2, 2018, however the exact dates vary from location to location. Please visit www.piefivepizza.com/paymentcardsecurity for a listing of the affected locations, the dates each location had affected transactions, and additional information on steps consumers can take to help protect themselves.

What We Are Doing?
We take the security of our customers’ information very seriously and, once we learned of this incident, we took immediate action including initiating an internal review, engaging independent forensic experts to assist us in the investigation and remediation of our systems and alerting law enforcement. While we are continuing to review and enhance our security measures moving forward to help prevent a future incident, we can confirm that this issue has been resolved and is no longer affecting transactions.

What You Can Do?
In order to help protect themselves, customers may wish to review credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible in order to determine if there are any discrepancies or unusual activity listed. We urge customers to remain vigilant and continue to monitor statements for unusual activity going forward. If they see anything they do not understand or that looks suspicious, or if they suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, customers should immediately notify the issuer of the credit or debit card. In instances of payment card fraud, it is important to note that cardholders are typically not responsible for any fraudulent activity that is reported in a timely fashion.

Although this incident did not include Social Security numbers, addresses, or other sensitive personal information, as a general practice, we recommend that you carefully check your credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries from creditors you did not initiate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. As an additional precaution, we are providing information and resources to help customers protect their identities. This includes an “Information About Identity Theft Protection” reference guide, available on our website at www.piefivepizza.com/paymentcardsecurity, which describes additional steps customers can take to help protect themselves, including recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection.

Separately, an app called At the Pool exposed databases that appeared to include data about user IDs, friends, photos and location check ins, as well as unprotected Facebook passwords for 22,000 users. The app — which was meant to help people meet up for offline activities — shut down in 2014.

UpGuard said it alerted Cultura Colectiva and Amazon about the breaches from Cultura Colectiva in January, but no action was taken until Wednesday morning.

The list includes Toyota Tokyo Sales Holdings, Tokyo Tokyo Motor, Tokyo Toyopet, Toyota Tokyo Corolla, Nets Toyota Tokyo, Lexus Koishikawa Sales, Jamil Shoji (Lexus Nerima), and Toyota West Tokyo Corolla.

Toyota said the servers that hackers accessed stored sales information on up to 3.1 million customers. The carmaker said there's an ongoing investigation to find out if hackers exfiltrated any of the data they had access to.

APT32?
This is the second cyber-security the company has announced this year, after disclosing a similar incident in late February, but affecting its Australian branch.

The attack on its Australian office was more disruptive in nature, bringing down Toyota Australia's ability to handle sales and deliver new cars, and has been attributed by some industry experts to APT32 (OceanLotus), a Vietnamese cyber-espionage unit with a known focus on the automotive industry.

Experts suggested that APT32 hackers might have targeted Toyota's Australia branch as a way to get into Toyota's more secure central network in Japan.

At the time, Toyota declined to confirm any of these theories and attribute the attack to APT32 hackers.

However, the company did say that it would start an internal audit of its IT systems following the attack on its Australian branch, and today's announcement only pours fuel on the APT32 theories.

On behalf of our client, Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), we write to provide you with this notification of an
incident that may have affected the personal information of one (1) Maryland resident. Apple recently
learned that the account of a customer service representative employed by a service provider was
compromised and used to acquire a customer’s payment card information.
On December 23, 2018, Apple’s Fraud Prevention Team identified an order that appeared to be
fraudulent and canceled it before the order could be processed. Apple later determined that the order had
been placed using the payment card information of a customer who had previously placed an order by
telephone on December 22nd. The order in question was taken by an employee of Concentrix, an Apple
service provider. Upon further investigation, Apple has determined that the Concentrix employee’s
computer was accessed by an unauthorized third party while the employee entered the customer’s
payment card information into his workstation. Upon identifying the fraudulent transaction, Apple
promptly contacted the customer to confirm that the transaction was not authorized.
The data elements obtained by the unauthorized third party included the customer’s name,
billing/shipping address, telephone number, email address, payment card account number, payment card
expiration date, and payment card verification number (i.e., CVV2).
Apple has taken steps in response to this incident to help ensure that Concentrix implements
measures to help prevent similar cyber-attacks on its employees in the future. Apple is also notifying the
individuals affected by this incident by mail and offering them one year of complementary credit
monitoring and identity theft protection services. A copy of the letter Apple is sending to customers is
attached for your reference.
Should you have further questions about this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at 202-

In accordance with Md. Code Ann. § 14-3504, I am writing to notify you regarding the
nature and circumstances of a recent data security incident.
On January 18, 2019, Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (“Shentel”)
learned that from June 2015 to January 2019, Shentel employee files from 2014 that
were required for the company to administer our human resources function were
inadvertently available on the company’s internal SharePoint site without appropriate
restrictions.
While there is no evidence that the files involved in this incident were ever exposed
outside of Shentel, they could have been viewed by others within the company.
The personal information on these files may have included employees’ names,
addresses, home phone numbers, work e-mail addresses, social security numbers,
and employment-related information.
Promptly after learning of the incident, we took steps to determine the nature of it and
restrict access to the files involved. We also retained data security experts to assist
in investigating the incident. That investigation concluded on March 7, 2019.
We have no evidence at this time of unauthorized access to the files involved here,
nor that any of the personal information in the files has been misused as a result of
this incident. Nevertheless, we have arranged to provide affected employees with 24
months of identity protection and credit monitoring services at no cost to them.

We represent ABM Industries Incorporated (“ABM”) located at One Liberty Plaza, 7th Floor, New
York, New York 10006. We are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the
security of some personal information relating to three hundred fifty-three (353) Maryland
residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with
any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, ABM
does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability
of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.
Nature of the Data Event
On June 14, 2018, ABM became aware of unusual activity in certain employee email accounts.
ABM immediately launched a detailed and exhaustive investigation to determine what happened
and what information may have been affected. With the assistance of computer forensics experts,
ABM learned that ABM was the victim of an email phishing incident which resulted in
unauthorized access to certain ABM employee email accounts from January 8, 2018 to August 7,
2018.
ABM undertook an in-depth review of the email accounts to determine if any information was
subject to unauthorized access. When the investigation could not rule out the possibility of such
access, ABM engaged in a programmatic and manual review of the email accounts to determine if
personal information existed in the accounts at the time of the incident. That review concluded on
December 26, 2018. ABM immediately took steps to confirm address information for the
potentially impacted individuals for purposes of providing notification to those individuals. 
Office of the Attorney General
March 12, 2019

ABM confirmed the email accounts contained personal information relating to three hundred fiftythree (353) Maryland residents including Social Security number, bank account/financial
information, driver’s license number, credit/debit card information, alien/foreign registration
number, and medical information.
Notice to Maryland Residents
On or about March 12, 2019, ABM provided written notice of this incident to affected individuals,
which includes approximately three hundred fifty-three (353) Maryland residents. Written notice
is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A. ABM
will notify additional individuals as they are identified and may update your office with this
additional information should additional Maryland residents be identified as affected.
Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Upon discovering the event, ABM moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess
the security of ABM’s systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. ABM has strict security
measures in place to protect information and upon learning of this incident, took additional steps
relating to its employee email accounts. ABM reset passwords for ABM email accounts and has
reviewed its existing policies and procedures. As a precautionary matter, ABM notified law
enforcement and also provided relevant regulatory notices and notification to the three major credit
reporting agencies.
ABM is also providing access to identity protection and credit monitoring services for one year,
through Kroll, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident,
at no cost to these individuals.
Additionally, ABM is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect
against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of
identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. ABM is providing individuals
with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information
on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies,
information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of
fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and
encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law
enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.
ABM has an ongoing commitment to data security and privacy. This ongoing commitment starts
with ABM’s Board of Directors, which requires regular cyber-security updates from its Chief
Information Officer on, among other things, current and future security threats and the state of
ABM’s use of security enhancing technology and outside security vendors. ABM is continually
exploring and implementing new technologies and vendors with increasing emphasis on
strengthening its security capabilities. For example, since 2017, ABM has employed the use of
malware detection software, implemented new technology, such as multi-factor authentication,
and has recently implemented third-party managed security services, with coverage 24 hours per
day, 7 days per week, to better enable detection and prevention of unauthorized activity on its

systems. ABM’s commitment to data security and privacy also includes company-wide antiphishing and cyber-security training, which ABM has been providing to its employees and which
it regularly updates to better prevent future such incidents.

Citrix has taken action to contain this incident. We commenced a forensic investigation; engaged a leading cyber security firm to assist; took actions to secure our internal network; and continue to cooperate with the FBI.

Citrix is moving as quickly as possible, with the understanding that these investigations are complex, dynamic and require time to conduct properly. In investigations of cyber incidents, the details matter, and we are committed to communicating appropriately when we have what we believe is credible and actionable information.

While our investigation is ongoing, based on what we know to date, it appears that the hackers may have accessed and downloaded business documents. The specific documents that may have been accessed, however, are currently unknown. At this time, there is no indication that the security of any Citrix product or service was compromised.

While not confirmed, the FBI has advised that the hackers likely used a tactic known as password spraying, a technique that exploits weak passwords. Once they gained a foothold with limited access, they worked to circumvent additional layers of security.

Citrix deeply regrets the impact this incident may have on affected customers. Citrix is committed to updating customers with more information as the investigation proceeds, and to continuing to work with the relevant law enforcement authorities.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/877890/000087789019000134/0000877890-19-000134-index.htm,Risk Factors | Legal Proceedings | MDA | Footnotes,2019-05-10 00:00:00,"Legal Matters
The Company accrues a liability for legal contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company's views on the probable outcomes of any pending claims, suits, assessments, regulatory investigations, or other legal proceedings change, changes in the Company's accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance, for matters in which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible, the Company provides disclosure of the possible loss or range of loss. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, however, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect.
Due to the nature of the Company's business, the Company is subject to patent infringement claims, including current litigation alleging infringement by various Company solutions and services. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations made in its pending litigation and intends to vigorously defend itself; however, it is unable currently to determine the ultimate outcome of these or similar matters or the potential exposure to loss, if any. In addition, the Company is a defendant in various litigation matters generally arising out of the normal course of business. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of these cases, the Company believes that outcomes that will materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows are reasonably possible but not estimable at this time.
The Company also is the victim of a cyberattack, in which, the Company believes, between October 13, 2018 and March 8, 2019, international cyber criminals gained intermittent access to Citrix’s internal network through “password spraying”, and over a limited number of days stole business documents and files from a shared network drive and a drive associated with a web-based tool used in the Company's consulting practice. The shared drive from which documents and files were stolen was used to store current and historical business documents and files, such as human resources and employee records, some of which contained sensitive and personal identification information of the Company's current and former employees and, in limited cases, their beneficiaries and dependents; customer engagement documents, including consulting services project materials, statements of work and proofs of concept, some of which were also stored on the drive associated with a web-based tool used in the Company's consulting practice; marketing materials; sales and finance documents; contracts and other legal records; and a wide assortment of other company records. The cyber criminals also may have accessed the individual virtual drives of a very limited number of compromised users, accessed the company email accounts of the same very limited number of compromised users, and launched without further exploitation a limited number of internal applications. The Company has commenced a substantial discovery process to review the documents and files stolen from the shared network drive and the drive associated with the web-based tool used in the Company's consulting practice, and the accessed documents and files on the individual virtual drives and the company e-mail accounts of the very limited number of comprised users. Based upon the Company’s investigation to date, there is no indication that the cyber criminals discovered and exploited any vulnerabilities in the Company’s products or customer cloud services to gain entry, and there is no indication that the security of any Citrix product or customer cloud service was compromised. The Company’s investigation remains ongoing. At this time, however, the Company is not aware of any impact to its financial reporting systems from this cyberattack. Additionally, the Company continues to assess its internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures related to cyberattacks as its investigation continues.
Further, the Company has a program of network-security (or cyber risk) insurance policies that, with standard exclusions, insure against the costs of detecting and mitigating cyber breaches, the cost of credit monitoring, and reasonable expenses for defending and settling privacy and network security lawsuits. These policies are subject to a $500,000 self-insured retention and a total insurance limit of $200.0 million. There can be no assurance, however, that this insurance coverage is sufficient to cover this or any other cyberattack. In addition to these insurance policies, the Company maintains customary business coverage under its crime, commercial general liability, and director and officer insurance policies.
Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of this cyberattack, based on the Company’s investigation to date, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that outcomes from potential unasserted claims related to this cyberattack could materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to the ongoing nature of the Company’s investigation, it is not possible to estimate the amount or a range of potential loss, if any, at this time.",0,,200000000,,,,,102.87000274658205,100.93000030517578,97.54000091552734,95.86000061035156,98.9800033569336,91.4000015258789,94.41000366210938,96.8000030517578,110.11000061035156,110.62000274658205,112.41000366210938,121.08000183105469,117.91000366210938,123.0,123.0

We represent Tribune Publishing Company (“TribPub”), 160 N. Stetson Avenue, Chicago, IL 60601 and

certain Maryland resident. The investigation into this event is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented
with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, TribPub does
not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law or personal jurisdiction.
Nature of the Data Security Incident
During December 2018, TribPub became aware of a pattern of suspicious activity relating to certain
employee email accounts and Workday payroll management accounts, including suspicious emails being
sent from the email accounts and suspicious direct deposit bank account information changes being made
to certain employees’ Workday accounts. In response, TribPub worked with an outside forensics expert to
investigate the nature and scope of the activity and updated relevant email and Workday credentials as
impacted accounts were identified. Through this investigation, TribPub continued to confirm the identities
of the impacted email account and Workday account users through February 21, 2019.
The investigation determined the following types of protected personal information relating to one (1)
Maryland resident were impacted in relation to this incident: Email and Workday account username and
password, and bank account and routing number.
TribPub’s investigation is ongoing to determine whether any additional protected personal information was
stored within impacted email accounts and potentially compromised. TribPub will continue to identify and
comply with all notification requirements as new information is learned.

We represent Data Facts, Inc. (“Data Facts”), 8000 Centerview Parkway, Cordova, Tennessee 38018, and
we write to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of personal information relating to
five (5) Maryland residents. Data Facts is a national and international provider of background screening
solutions for clients such as, Walker and Dunlop, LLC. Data Facts’ investigation into this event is ongoing
and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission or
additional requests from Data Facts clients to provide notice on their behalf. By providing this notice, Data
Facts does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability
of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.
Nature of the Data Event
On November 5, 2018, Data Facts learned that a Data Facts employee email account was accessed by an
unknown party. That account contained personally identifiable information provided to Data Facts by
clients for the purpose of conducting background checks. Although Data Facts has no evidence to suggest
that private information was misused, the possibility that emails and/or attachments in the account were
viewed by the unauthorized party could not be ruled out. On December 7, 2018, Data Facts’ investigation
confirmed certain consumers’ information was present in the account.
Data Facts takes data privacy and this incident very seriously. Immediately upon becoming aware of the
incident, Data Facts took steps to block access to the account by resetting passwords and hired a leading
forensics firm to help investigate. Through that investigation and following an extensive programmatic and
manual review of the emails and attachments, Data Facts determined that an unauthorized party had access
to records which may have included consumer name, address, Driver’s License number and Social Security
number.

Notice to Maryland Residents
On or about December 20, 2018, Data Facts began notifying the affected Clients whose consumers’
sensitive information was present in the account and offered to notify affected consumers and applicable
regulators on their behalf. Once Data Facts received approval from Walker and Dunlop, LLC, Data Facts
proceeded to notify affected individuals.
On March 6, 2019, Data Facts mailed written notice of this incident to five (5) Maryland residents affected
in the incident, on behalf of Walker and Dunlop, LLC in substantially the same form as the letter attached
hereto and labeled as Exhibit A.
Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Upon discovering this incident, Data Facts immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature
and scope of the event, as well as whose data may potentially be affected. At Walker and Dunlop, LLC’s
request, Data Facts is mailing written notice to affected consumers and certain regulators. This notice
includes guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, how to place a fraud alert and
security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies,
information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and
identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to
contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report
attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. As an added precaution, Data Facts arranged to have AllClear
ID provide the affected consumers twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services
at no cost to the individual. Data Facts is also providing notice of this event to other state and federal
regulators as requested.
Data Facts has taken steps to ensure the security of the information they store. As part of its ongoing efforts
to help prevent another incident from occurring in the future, it is re-educating employees on cyber best
practices and enhancing existing security measures by implementing two-factor authentication for remote
email access. Data Facts also implemented a 60-day forced password reset protocol across all systems and
subscribed to an email security program for inbound and outbound filtering and blocking of emails
potentially containing personally identifiable information.

Background
Protective provides insurance and re-insurance services to various clients within the transportation
industry. On or about September 17, 2018, Protective became aware of suspicious activity
occurring within employee email accounts. Protective immediately launched an investigation and
began working with third-party forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the
potential data event. On October 16, 2018, Protective identified the individuals who may have had
information accessible as a result of the incident and promptly began a review of their files to
identify contact information for these impacted individuals and the data owner clients to whom
these individuals relate. This review involved conducting internal research for the individuals’
contact information and obtaining missing addresses from impacted data owners.

On or about January 30, 2019, Protective began notifying data owners, which are Protective
Insureds and Re-insureds, whose own clients may have been affected by this incident. In this

on their behalf. Protective also requested address information from the data owners for the
potentially impacted individuals. Once these data owners provided approval and missing address
information, Protective worked to provide written notice to impacted individuals on behalf of the
data owners, as directed.
The investigation determined that the types of personal information that may have been accessible
within the impacted email accounts includes: name and medical information. To date, Protective
has not received any reports of the misuse of any personal information as a result of this event.
Notice to Maryland Residents
Pursuant to approval from its data owner clients, Protective began mailing written notice of this
incident to the affected individuals on March 1, 2019, in substantially the same form as the letter
attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Upon discovering the potential unauthorized access to the employee email accounts, Protective
immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this incident, as well
as determine what data may potentially be affected. The investigation included working with an
external security firm. Protective provided notice to all Insureds and Re-insured data owners
whose clients’ information was accessible within the impacted email accounts, and Protective will
be providing written notice to impacted individuals, as directed by the data owners.
Protective is offering individuals impacted by this event with access to two (2) years of
complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion, and the
contact information for a dedicated call center for potentially affected individuals to contact with

contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free
credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing
account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal
Trade Commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual

maintained by Del Taco. It is possible the incident may have involved an unauthorized disclosure of your 
personal information.  
WHAT HAPPENED?  On January 28, 2019, we learned through an investigation that certain information of Del 
Taco company team members may have been acquired without authorization as a result of a computer scheme 
known as “phishing,” where user credentials/passwords are inadvertently disclosed to an unauthorized party. 
Since learning of the incident, we immediately began our investigation into the attack, blocked further attempts, 
and implemented additional security measures.  
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?  We have reason to believe that information you provided to Del Taco 
as a part of your employment could have been acquired by an unauthorized person. That information 
potentially includes your name and social security number. Other, non‐personal information (such as dates of 
employment and shift information) related to your employment with Del Taco may have also been acquired. To

WHAT WE ARE DOING.  First and foremost, we want to sincerely apologize to you if any of your personal 
information was accessed or acquired as a result of this incident. We recognize that this issue can be frustrating, 
and we are taking steps to protect you and your personal information. Del Taco is conducting a thorough review

(“Five Below”) understands the importance of protecting the payment card information of our
customers. We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved that information. This letter
explains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.
What Happened?
Our security team learned of suspicious activity on our website on January 11, 2019. We immediately began an
investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm. On January 17, 2019, the investigation identified
the potential for unauthorized access to payment card data. Purchases made in our stores were not affected by this
incident.
What Information Was Involved?
Findings from the investigation suggest that certain of our customers’ payment card information, including name,
address, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV), may have been obtained by an
unauthorized third party. We believe the incident only involved customers who entered information on our website’s
checkout page between November 13, 2018 and January 11, 2019. We are notifying you because you placed or
attempted an order on www.fivebelow.com during that time using a payment card ending in <<Last 4 Card #>>.
What We Are Doing.
We take the security of our customers’ personal information very seriously. To help prevent a similar incident from
occurring in the future we have further enhanced the security measures for our website. In addition, we are working
with the payment card networks so that banks that issue payment cards can be made aware.
What You Can Do.
We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. You should
immediately report any such charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally
provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported. The phone number to
call is usually on the back of your payment card.

Data including users’ profile names, stored links to profile pictures and their Instagram ID is available in the database, which researcher Oliver Hough found on the Shodan web scanning service. The database, physically located in the U.K., includes 14,526,602 entries, according to a screenshot Hough tweeted Friday. Entries also have empty fields for home addresses and telephone numbers, he said.

It’s not clear who is logging the information. But Hough suggested a third party could be scraping Instagram and storing public data for analysis later, either for targeted marketing or another purpose. He suggested the information could be combined with unrelated databases of stolen passwords, which hackers could correlate with the usernames leaked here to try to infiltrate victims’ accounts.

“On the black hat side of things, well, it’s 14 million valid usernames,” he said. “Combine that with large password lists and I’m sure it would be a fun day.”

Instagram did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CyberScoop.

Social media companies previously have tried to stop outsiders from scraping public information about user profiles.

Professional networking site LinkedIn is trying to prevent hiQ Labs, a data science company, from using public data about LinkedIn user data to predict which employees who are most likely to be seeking a new job. The company sells information to clients including CapitalOne, eBay and GoDaddy, according to Courthouse News. LinkedIn argued hiQ violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a 1984, anti-hacking law, by using bots to take public data.

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>,
We are writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at Don Best Sports Corporation and DBS Canada
Corporation (together, “Don Best”) between October 12, 2018 and October 28, 2018, that involved an unauthorized
disclosure of some of your personal information. The privacy and protection of our customers’ information is a matter
we take very seriously, and we have worked swiftly to resolve the incident. We deeply regret this incident and, as
described below, we are taking steps to mitigate potential harm to you as a result of this incident.
What Happened
On November 1, 2018, Scientific Games Corporation (“Scientific Games”) acquired Don Best. On December 21, 2018,
while integrating the newly acquired Don Best network with that of Scientific Games, we learned that unauthorized
individuals may have accessed the Don Best network. We immediately began an investigation and learned that
between October 12, 2018 and October 28, 2018 Don Best suffered a malware attack.
What Information Was Involved
Based on Don Best’s investigation to date, we believe that the unauthorized user accessed a Don Best database
from which the unauthorized user accessed or acquired customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and
usernames (which is a customer’s e-mail address) and passwords. While the database at issue also stored credit
card information, our investigation indicates that no credit card information was accessed or acquired.
What We Are Doing
Since becoming aware of this incident, Don Best has taken steps to remove the malware and to further improve the
security of the Don Best network. Don Best is also resetting all customer passwords. Your trust is a top priority for
Don Best, and we deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause.
What You Can Do
There are steps you can take to protect yourself, such as changing your password, placing a freeze on your credit
report, or contacting the appropriate authorities if you believe you have been the victim of identity theft. The enclosed
“Identity Theft Protection Tips” describes some of these steps. Of course, it is always important that you remain
vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for signs of fraud.

I am writing on behalf of our client, Regency Centers Corporation (“Regency”), to notify
you of a security incident involving Maryland residents.
On December 20, 2018, Regency’s ongoing investigation into a phishing email incident
determined that an unauthorized person gained access to an employee’s email account. Upon
learning of the incident, Regency immediately took action to secure the account, commenced an
investigation and engaged a leading cybersecurity firm to assist. The investigation was unable to
determine which emails and attachments may have been viewed by the unauthorized person.
Therefore, Regency reviewed the full contents of the account to identify personal information.
Regency’s review determined that emails or attachments that could have been viewed by the
unauthorized person contained the personal information of 75 Maryland residents. While the
personal information involved varied for each individual, the information included names, Social
Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and financial account numbers.
Beginning today, January 25, 2019, Regency will mail notification letters to the 75
Maryland residents in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-3504 via United States

Aetna is writing to notify the Office of the Attorney General (the “Office”) that it recently
determined that a data breach that occurred at one of its vendors, Centerstone Insurance
and Financial Services, Inc. d/b/a BenefitMall (“BenefitMall”), affected approximately
1,215 Maryland residents who are members of a fully-insured Aetna health benefit plan
and approximately 186 Maryland residents who are members of self-funded employee
benefit plans for which Aetna serves as the third party administrator. Aetna is providing
this notice to the Office in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-3504(h).
Please note that no Aetna system or service, and no data maintained by Aetna, was
involved in this data breach.
I. Brief Description of the Breach
On December 11, 2018, BenefitMall, a general agent who also acts as a third-party vendor
that Aetna utilizes to provide administrative services related to employee benefits (e.g.,
enrollment and billing services), notified Aetna that phishing attacks, which occurred
between approximately June 2018 and October 19, 2018, had compromised certain
BenefitMall employee email accounts containing Aetna member information. BenefitMall
has a primary place of business at 12404 Park Central Drive, Suite 400S Dallas, Texas
75251, and Aetna considers Tiffany Stiller with a phone number of (818) 226-6517 Ext
286517 to be its primary contact at BenefitMall.
BenefitMall also informed Aetna that it became aware of these attacks on October 11,
2018 and that the incident has since been contained. Based upon its investigation,
BenefitMall determined that an unidentified, unauthorized third party was able to obtain
correspondence containing personal information. BenefitMall informed Aetna that the
affected correspondence generally included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, 
2
7325178v1
dates of birth, zip codes, bank account numbers, plan descriptions, premium payment
amounts, and health plan beneficiary numbers.
BenefitMall informed Aetna that it retained a cybersecurity forensics firm to assist in a
thorough investigation of the incident and that it has implemented additional security
measures designed to protect employee email accounts, including two-factor authentication
for access to its email system. Based upon conversations with BenefitMall, Aetna’s
understanding is that the information was not encrypted and that the information has not
been recovered. Additionally, BenefitMall informed Aetna that it reported the incident to
law enforcement.
II. How Aetna Responded
On December 18, 2018, BenefitMall provided Aetna with a cursory list of affected
individuals. Because the list lacked certain important information, Aetna promptly
initiated a review of this list to identify Aetna members, their benefit plans, and their
addresses. The list Aetna received from BenefitMall did not include this information and
contained a large number of duplicates. Aetna worked diligently, and expended
considerable time and resources, to review the limited, inconsistent personal information
included in the BenefitMall list to locate the addresses of the individuals listed, so that
Aetna could provide notice to affected individuals as soon as possible. Aetna has also had
several communications with BenefitMall regarding this breach to assist in its own
investigation and review of the matter. Additionally, Aetna has reviewed BenefitMall’s
efforts to remediate the breach and ensure that it does not happen again.
In accordance with its obligations set forth at 45 C.F.R. § 164.404 (notifications to
individuals by a HIPAA covered entity) and Maryland law, Aetna is issuing notification to
the impacted members of fully-insured plans by first class U.S. mail. In addition, as
explained above, this breach also affected members of self-funded employee benefit plans
for which Aetna serves as the third party administrator. Aetna has agreed to fulfill the
breach notification obligations of these self-funded plans with respect to this breach,
including notification to individuals and relevant federal and state regulators. Therefore,
by means of this letter, Aetna is providing notice to your office on behalf of the self-funded
plans listed in the attached document.
Aetna anticipates that the mailing of all such notifications will commence on January 30,
2019. Aetna will also be offering each such individual, at no cost, two (2) years of Equifax
Credit Watch™ Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring Identity Theft Protection. A template copy
of the notification that will be sent to impacted members is attached. Aetna is also
notifying other federal and state regulatory agencies as required by law.

standards. If you have any questions, you may contact me at 860-273-1091 and

BinaryEdge search engine screen capture with the database info

At the same time, each record did not represent a single report, but rather different parts of the documents. Optical character recognition (OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text and was structured as follows:

“text” (data from documents)
“documentName”
“pageLength”
“uri” (IP used to retrieve the data)
“clientID”
“apiVersion”
“createdEpoch”
“isStartPage” (true or false)


These documents contained highly sensitive data, such as social security numbers, names, phones, addresses, credit history, and other details which are usually part of a mortgage or credit report. This information would be a gold mine for cyber criminals who would have everything they need to steal identities, file false tax returns, get loans or credit cards.

It is hard to tell, how many people were actually affected in the breach. Given the sensitivity of data, I have immediately initiated a responsible disclosure protocol to privately alert the alleged owner of the Elasticsearch cluster.

For background: to discover data breaches, leakages, and vulnerabilities on the Internet, we use public search engines only, such as Shodan, Censys etc. When we find a public database (data that’s fully accessible to anyone without any restrictions) we collect several digital samples for further analysis. If these samples contain any kind of private and sensitive data, we employ a Responsible Disclosure model to privately communicate the findings with data owners (the company or organization that left the information publicly accessible) and help them implement specific security safeguards to protect their private data. – Bob Diachenko

While researching the contents of the database I noticed that a massive amount of the documents referenced the CitiFinancial company. With this connection I sent a notification to Citi’s responsible disclosure emails on Jan 10. The following day I received additional request for technical details and got in touch with a Citi representative.

On Jan 15th, the instance has been taken offline and the data was secured. The representative from Citi was grateful for a responsible notification, but did not send any statement of clarification. In the message they sent to Zack Whitaker of Techcrunch (who assisted me in this investigation) reads as follows:

It appears the third party is a company that had purchased the loans and we have found no evidence that Citi’s systems were compromised

We teamed up with Zack to find out who was behind this data breach and analyzed history of IP that was part of database structure as “http://XX.XX.XXX.XXX:10013/api/documents/download/unique_ID“.

Read Zack’s take on this incident here: https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/financial-files/

RiskIQ Digital Footprint Snapshot showed a DNS resolution for that IP which lead us to a company named Ascension Data & Analytics, which specializes on variety of products and services for the financial industry, including document management with OCR, progressive property reports etc.

There were also references of Ascension Data & Analytics throughout the database as well, which left almost no doubts as of the ultimate owner of the exposed documents. In any case, we will update this publication if/when we hear back from Ascension.

The Danger of Leaving the Front Door Open
We have previously reported that the lack of authentication allowed the installation of malware or ransomware on the Elasticsearch servers. The public configuration allows the possibility of cybercriminals to manage the entire system with full administrative privileges. Once the malware is in place criminals could remotely access the server resources and even launch a code execution to steal or completely destroy any saved data the server contains.

Although companies acted fast to secure their data it is unclear how long it may have been publicly available or who else might have accessed the millions of records containing PII. Data privacy should always be a top priority, but companies need to be proactive when it comes to data protection.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,61.849998474121094,64.13999938964844,60.97999954223633,69.08999633789061,64.66000366210939,67.97000122070311,71.11000061035156,63.90999984741211,69.55000305175781,72.05999755859375,74.87000274658203,78.76000213623047,80.0999984741211,76.5,74.83333333333333

The LA Times cited an inside source at its former mother company who claimed the printing outage was caused by an infection with the Ryuk ransomware.
This type of ransomware was first described in a Check Point report published over the summer. The ransomware is primarily deployed in targeted attacks on high-value targets with the hopes of netting cyber-criminals profits from companies that can't afford a major downtime.

Additionally, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation if we become subject to claims in the future, and reputational harm arising out of such claims or litigation may cause our customers to lose confidence in our ability to safeguard their information.",105000,,,,,,,29.770000457763672,32.290000915527344,33.779998779296875,32.110000610351555,32.150001525878906,27.95000076293945,28.07999992370605,29.149999618530273,28.34000015258789,29.270000457763672,29.209999084472656,29.70000076293945,30.649999618530273,,

We write to notify you that Discovery Communications, LLC (""Discovery"") was the target of an
unauthorized third party intrusion that resulted in the compromise of certain employee information. The
intrusion was discovered by Discovery last week. Specifically, Discovery has learned that the work login
password credentials of a limited number of Discovery employees may have been
compromised. Discovery identified the security intrusion quickly and took immediate action to halt
it. Discovery estimates that approximately 2 (two) Maryland residents were affected by this incident. For
the limited number of employees whose information may have been compromised, the unauthorized
party may have had access to those employees' login password credentials (username and password).
Upon becoming aware of the security incident, Discovery immediately took steps to halt it, including
engaging external cybersecurity consultants to help investigate the nature of the intrusion and take steps
to remediate the issue, as well as to prevent recurrence. The compromised accounts were immediately
blocked and a password reset was initiated. Discovery will provide email notice to potentially affected
Maryland employees on December 18, 2018 or immediately after the submission of this notice. As of the
date of this notice, Discovery has no reason to believe that any employee credentials were used to gain
unauthorized access to Discovery's systems.
Discovery has also encouraged potentially affected employees to reset their work passwords, to the
extent they were not automatically reset. Furthermore, Discovery has recommended that employees also
reset the passwords to their personal accounts, particularly in the event that those passwords are the
same or similar to the passwords that was compromised.
Employees potentially affected by this intrusion have been informed that they may contact their HR
business partner if they have any questions and to clarify any concerns regarding this matter. Attached
is a copy of the notice that will be provided to affected employees. Please feel free to contact me at
312-861-3077, should you have any further questions about this matter.

(KBAK/KBFX) — On Friday, Facebook users around the world woke up to news of the company suffering from yet another data breach.

This time, the company has admitted that, due to a bug, as many as 6.8 million users' photos may have been exposed through third party apps associated with their Facebook accounts.
Many analysts attribute it, at least in part, to growing pains.

""I think that they're definitely learning as they go. What they're doing is unprecedented. You know, never before in history has anyone had access to 6.8 million photos. And, so, I think that the fact that they're doing something that's so different and so out of the box, this is just a given,” Madison Carter of Deprigo, a Bakersfield-based digital media agency, said.
Carter says that although the company's image will likely take a hit from the latest scandal, she believes that it will eventually bounce back.
""We're definitely becoming numb to it as a society. It's so hard to have a big reaction every time something like this happens, because it happens so frequently now,” she said.
But despite the increased frequency of big data breaches, many people still don't think that something like that could ever happen to them.
""I don't feel like I'm going to be the one, you know I truly don't feel like I'm going to be affected by it,” Daniel Oakley, of Bakersfield, said.
And if there's a silver lining in all this, Carter believes that it will be an increased level of security at companies like Facebook.
Although, she still encourages everyone to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves.
""First and foremost, make sure your privacy settings are set to where you want them to be. If you don't want everyone to have access to your photos, make your page private,” Carter said. “If you don't want anyone ever to see these photos, don't let them anywhere near the Internet at any point in time.""", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,145.00999450683594,145.38999938964844,164.07000732421875,173.3699951171875,179.10000610351562,181.5399932861328,177.47000122070312,204.8699951171875,188.4499969482422,187.19000244140625,183.27999877929688,193.19000244140625,194.1100006103516,160.0,145.0909090909091

Through the bug, outside app developers who requested permission to view personal information that a user placed on their Google+ profile — such as name, email and occupation — were granted permission to view that profile, even if it was set to private. The breach did not turn over any financial data, national identification numbers or passwords.

Google+, which launched in 2011 as a means for Google to compete in the social network space, will now shut down in April instead of August, the company said.
App developers inadvertently had access to users' information for six days following a November software update, according to the company. In total, 52.5 million users were affected.
 
This marks the second data breach for Google's disappointing social network. The first occurred in October, when up to 500,000 users' data was compromised. Shortly after, Google announced it would shut down the platform in 2019.
""We understand that our ability to build reliable products that protect your data drives user trust,"" David Thacker, Google’s vice president of product management, said in a statement Monday. ""We have always taken this seriously, and we continue to invest in our privacy programs to refine internal privacy review processes, create powerful data controls and engage with users, researchers, and policymakers to get their feedback and improve our programs.""

Brown & Brown, Inc, involving the security of your information and the measures we are taking to protect
your information.
What Happened?
We recently learned that emails within one of our employee’s email accounts may have been forwarded to an
external email address not affiliated with us.
What We Are Doing.
We immediately launched an investigation to analyze the extent of any compromise to the email accounts
and the security of the emails and attachments contained within. After an extensive investigation, our
information technology team concluded that it was possible that an unauthorized individual may have had
access to the emails contained in the impacted email account.
What Information Was Involved?
We devoted considerable time and effort to determine what information was contained in the affected email
accounts. Based on our comprehensive investigation and document review, which concluded on November
27, 2018, we discovered that the compromised email accounts contained your full name and drivers’ license
number. Your Social Security number was not impacted by this incident.
What You Can Do.
Although these certain emails were forwarded to an unauthorized email account, we have no evidence that
any of the information has been misused. However, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to make you
aware of the incident and suggest steps that you should take to protect yourself. Further, you should remain
vigilant in reviewing your financial account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis.
To protect you and your information, we are providing you with 12 months of free credit monitoring and
identity theft protection services through TransUnion. This service helps detect possible misuse of your
personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification

In late November, though, the Humble Bundle team sent out an alert of a different kind: a data breach had occurred. The company revealed that a bug in the company’s code allowed someone to compare a list of email addresses to see the if they had a Humble Bundle subscription, check if it was active, see when the plan expired, and find out if the account had a referral bonus. 

While the Humble Bundle servers did not relinquish any personal or payment information, it’s certainly not good that a hacker (or group of hackers) could compare emails to see if anyone was a Humble Bundle subscriber. Now that the hackers have this information, they know where to target mailblasts pretending to be from Humble Bundle. These blasts can imply things like Humble Bundle needing new subscription information, and can misdirect the user away from the authentic website. The official MalwareBytes blog suggests that Humble Bundle users be acutely aware of suspicious emails, especially any of them demanding updated contact or payment information.

That means the breach likely isn’t as significant as the massive Bethesda blunder from last week, which involved much more personal information being revealed. While more sensitive information was leaked in the Bethesda error, it appears to be the result of a system error rather than a targeted attack. In any event, Humble Bundle officially recommends that users enable two-step verification on their accounts, don’t share password information, and – as MalWare Bytes suggested – watch out for phishing attempts. 
Gamers still interested in the December 2018 Humble Bundle will get a curious mix of games like the Megaman Legacy Collection, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Definitive Experience, the Zombie Army trilogy, Cities: Skylines, and more. Those who subscribe to the $12 monthly bundle will also get copies of Just Cause 3: XXL Edition, Project Cars 2, and Wizard of Legend, with portions of the proceeds going towards the DirectRelief charity. With so much value going into these low-priced bundles, it’s no surprise that customers often flock to the retail website – but unfortunately, that evidently makes it a target for users with nefarious intentions, too.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,70.47000122070312,70.75,74.98999786376953,84.26000213623047,88.30000305175781,88.80000305175781,85.56999969482422,88.33999633789062,82.12999725341797,89.05999755859375,90.9499969482422,100.43000030517578,95.16000366210938,,

determine what information the unauthorized individual may have accessed. After a thorough forensic investigation—
which required a review of logs associated with the mailbox access—we determined, on November 20, 2018, that the
unauthorized individual may have accessed information in the email account that contained your name and Social
Security number.

Dallas-based Web designer Brandon Sheehy discovered that slightly modifying the link in the confirmation email he received and pasting that into a Web browser revealed another customer’s order, including their name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, email address, items and total amount purchased, delivery date, tracking link, and the last four digits of the customer’s credit card number.
Sheehy said after discovering the weakness, his mind quickly turned to the various ways that crooks might exploit it.
“My first thought was they could track a package of jewelry to someone’s door and swipe it off their doorstep,” he said. “My second thought was that someone could call Jared’s customers and pretend to be Jared, reading the last four digits of the customer’s card and saying there’d been a problem with the order, and if they could get a different card for the customer they could run it right away and get the order out quickly. That would be a pretty convincing scam. Or just targeted phishing attacks.”
Concerned that his own information was similarly exposed, Sheehy contacted Jared parent company Signet Jewelers and asked them to fix the data exposure. When several weeks passed and Sheehy could still view his information and that of other Jared customers, he reached out to KrebsOnSecurity.
Scott Lancaster, chief information security officer at Signet, said the company did fix the problem for all future orders shortly after receiving a customer’s complaint. But Lancaster said Signet neglected to remedy the data exposure for all past orders until contacted by KrebsOnSecurity.
“When a customer first brought this matter to our attention in early November, we fixed it for all new orders going forward,” Lancaster said. “But we didn’t notice at the time that this applied to all past orders as well as future orders.”
Lancaster said the problem affected only orders made online through jared.com and kay.com, and that the weakness was not present on the sites of the company’s other jewelry brands, such as Zales and Piercing Pagoda.
Data exposures like these are some of the most common yet preventable for online retailers. In July, identity theft protection service LifeLock corrected an information disclosure flaw that exposed the email address of millions of subscribers. And in April 2018, PaneraBread.com remedied a weakness exposing millions of customer names, email and physical addresses, birthdays and partial credit card numbers.
Sheehy said he’s glad Signet has fully fixed the bug, but said he was annoyed that it seems like many companies fail to address or even acknowledge such failures unless and until they’re confronted by the news media.
“Being a Web developer, the only thing I can chalk this up to is complete incompetence, and being very lazy and indifferent to your customers’ data,” he said. “This isn’t novel stuff, it’s basic Web site security.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,53.040000915527344,33.06999969482422,23.96999931335449,28.79999923706055,27.649999618530273,22.76000022888184,19.1200008392334,16.379999160766598,17.270000457763672,11.079999923706056,15.850000381469727,16.200000762939453,17.399999618530273,42.0,36.806999999999995

BETHESDA, MD - November 30, 2018 - Marriott has taken measures to investigate and address a data security incident involving the Starwood guest reservation database. On November 19, 2018, the investigation determined that there was unauthorized access to the database, which contained guest information relating to reservations at Starwood properties* on or before September 10, 2018.

On September 8, 2018, Marriott received an alert from an internal security tool regarding an attempt to access the Starwood guest reservation database in the United States. Marriott quickly engaged leading security experts to help determine what occurred. Marriott learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014. The company recently discovered that an unauthorized party had copied and encrypted information, and took steps towards removing it. On November 19, 2018, Marriott was able to decrypt the information and determined that the contents were from the Starwood guest reservation database.

The company has not finished identifying duplicate information in the database, but believes it contains information on up to approximately 500 million guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property. For approximately 327 million of these guests, the information includes some combination of name, mailing address, phone number, email address, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest (“SPG”) account information, date of birth, gender, arrival and departure information, reservation date, and communication preferences. For some, the information also includes payment card numbers and payment card expiration dates, but the payment card numbers were encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128).  There are two components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers, and at this point, Marriott has not been able to rule out the possibility that both were taken. For the remaining guests, the information was limited to name and sometimes other data such as mailing address, email address, or other information. 

Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation. The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities.

“We deeply regret this incident happened,” said Arne Sorenson, Marriott’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves. We are doing everything we can to support our guests, and using lessons learned to be better moving forward.”

“Today, Marriott is reaffirming our commitment to our guests around the world. We are working hard to ensure our guests have answers to questions about their personal information, with a dedicated website and call center. We will also continue to support the efforts of law enforcement and to work with leading security experts to improve. Finally, we are devoting the resources necessary to phase out Starwood systems and accelerate the ongoing security enhancements to our network,” Mr. Sorenson continued.

On November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the “Data Security Incident”). Working with leading security experts, we determined that there was unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014 and that an unauthorized party had copied information from the Starwood reservations database and taken steps towards removing it. The information copied from the Starwood reservations database over time included information about guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property, including names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers, payment card numbers and expiration dates, Starwood Preferred Guest account information, dates of birth, gender, arrival and departure information, reservation dates, and communication preferences. The combination of information varied by guest. Based on our analysis as of the date of this filing, we believe that the upper limit for the total number of guest records involved in this incident is approximately 383 million records. In many instances, there appear to be multiple records for the same guest, so we have concluded with a fair degree of certainty that information for fewer than 383 million unique guests was involved, although we are currently unable to quantify that lower number because of the nature of the data in the database. Based on our analysis as of the date of this filing, we believe that the information accessed by an unauthorized third party included approximately 5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers, approximately 18.5 million encrypted passport numbers and approximately 9.1 million encrypted payment card numbers (approximately 385,000 of which cards were unexpired as of September 2018). Certain data analytics work continues, including by the investigative firm engaged on behalf of the payment card networks, and based on the preliminary information we have as of the date of this filing, we believe that the information accessed by an unauthorized third party could include several thousand unencrypted payment card numbers.
Upon receiving information that an alert from an internal security tool was related to an attempt to access the Starwood reservations database, we quickly engaged leading security experts to conduct a comprehensive forensic review to determine the scope of the intrusion, including the specific data impacted, and assist with containment measures. While that forensic review of the incident is now complete, certain data analytics work continues. We reported this incident to law enforcement and continue to support their investigation. We have completed the planned phase out of the operation of the Starwood reservations database, effective as of the end of 2018.
Following the Data Security Incident, we began a guest outreach effort and offered certain services to help guests monitor and protect their information. Promptly following our announcement of the incident, we began sending emails on a rolling basis directly to various Starwood guests whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservations database, and we completed sending these emails on December 21, 2018. We also established a multi-language dedicated website and multi-language call center to answer guests’ questions about the incident. The dedicated website provides guests details of the incident, the information affected, the steps being taken to investigate, FAQs and information about how guests can monitor and protect their information. We are offering free web monitoring solutions for affected guests in certain jurisdictions where the monitoring services are available.
To date, we have not seen a meaningful impact on demand as a result of the Data Security Incident.
We are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident. However, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. We maintain insurance designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Data Security Incident. We expect that the cost of such insurance will increase significantly in 2019 and future years. We expect to incur significant expenses associated with the Data Security Incident in future periods, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations, increased expenses and capital investments for IT and information security, incident response and customer care, and increased expenses for insurance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements.

The incident did not involve orders placed on the 1800Flowers.com website. This letter explains the incident, measures we have taken to remediate the incident, and steps you can take in response. What Happened? Our security team was made aware of suspicious activity on the Canadian Website. We immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm and disabled the website. On October 30, 2018, the investigation identified unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used to make purchases on the Canadian Website from August 15, 2014 to September 15, 2018. What Information Was Involved? Findings from the investigation suggest that the information collected included your first and last name, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code. We are notifying you because you may have placed an order on the Canadian Website between August 15, 2014 and September 15, 2018 using a payment card ending in <<variable data – 4 digit CC #>>. What We Are Doing. We take the security of our customers’ personal information very seriously. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have redesigned the Canadian Website and implemented additional security measures. We are also working with the payment card networks so that banks and other entities that issue payment cards can be made aware. What You Can Do. We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. You should immediately report any such charges to the bank, credit union or credit card company that issued your card because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported.

While Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has urged TransUnion to ensure the personal information of millions of Hongkongers is protected, police are investigating the company’s complaint about the unauthorised access to its data.
Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao on Wednesday claimed it had easily obtained credit reports for a number of high-profile public figures, including Lam and Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po due to TransUnion’s simple online authentication procedures.
Time to get serious about cybersecurity
The credit reporting agency, which holds the consumer information of 500 million people in more than 30 countries, said it had reported Ming Pao to police and temporarily suspended online services.
“Our preliminary findings indicate that the reporter accessed consumer information for a very limited number of Hong Kong consumers in violation of Hong Kong data privacy law,” the agency said. “We have contacted law enforcement to further investigate this matter.”

Lam said she had received a letter from TransUnion assuring her of remedial action.
“TransUnion, which holds the personal data of many Hong Kong citizens, has a responsibility to ensure effective security measures are in place to protect consumers’ interest,” Lam said.
The city’s banking regulator, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), through the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), demanded TransUnion immediately suspend its online credit report services. It also urged local banks involved to sign formal contracts with such agencies to ensure they followed privacy rules.
The HKAB said it had requested TransUnion to conduct a full investigation into the issue and take necessary enhanced security controls and measures as soon as possible.
TransUnion is not regulated by any official body in Hong Kong, even though it holds the consumer data of 5.4 million people in the city.
Lawmakers Charles Mok of the IT sector and Christopher Cheung Wah-fung of the finance industry urged the HKMA and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to address the issue immediately.

The issue is not just its sloppy authentication system, it is also about why it is not regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
Charles Mok, lawmaker for IT sector
“The issue is not just its sloppy authentication system, it is also about why it is not regulated by the HKMA,” Mok said. “Why should I pay for a third party to know my own credit data or why do I need to enter into a marketing relationship with another commercial entity to get a glimpse of my own credit profile, which should be free of charge? Is this reasonable?”
Chicago-based TransUnion’s Hong Kong credit bureau was established in 1982 with an aim to share with banks and businesses the credit profiles of customers seeking to borrow money or apply for credit cards. The company is currently the primary supplier of data and value-added solutions to the city’s top 10 banks and some 140 financial institutions.

TransUnion compiles credit reports after obtaining consumer data from banks or money lenders, which then use the information to evaluate customers’ financial strength.
On its website the company says the credit reports it has amassed contain personal data, repayment records for credit accounts, and details of credit applications including credit cards, personal loans and mortgages.
Mok said TransUnion’s business model had gone beyond that by commercialising consumers’ credit data.
Formal investigation to be launched into Cathay Pacific data breach
The HKMA said the credit information service provided by the company did not come under its regulatory reach.
“This is the loophole,” Mok said. “The original business model was just sharing information between the company and banks or lending institutions when customers are trying to get a loan. But there are institutions that can read your profile and pitch for lending services or, even worse, by expanding their services to make a profit out of the data. Is it fair to consumers? It has moved beyond its original business model.”

The company should deploy two-factor verification, which is a security process that involves two different layers of authentication

Members of the public who want to access their personal profile on TransUnion are charged HK$280.
Lawmaker Cheung said it would make sense to have the HKMA regulate TransUnion and similar service providers.
“The authority and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner should work out a regulatory regime for it,” he said.
Privacy commissioner Stephen Wong Kai-yi said his office was looking into the company’s security issue, with initial findings showing TransUnion should have done better in designing the process for authenticating personal data.

Though it is possible some of this information was removed from Dell’s network, our investigations found no conclusive evidence that any was extracted. Additionally, Dell cybersecurity measures are in place to limit the impact of any potential exposure. These include the hashing of our customers’ passwords and a mandatory Dell.com password reset. Credit card and other sensitive customer information was not targeted. The incident did not impact any Dell products or services.

Upon detection of the attempted extraction, Dell immediately implemented countermeasures and initiated an investigation. Dell also retained a digital forensics firm to conduct an independent investigation and has engaged law enforcement.

In this age of highly sophisticated information security threats, Dell is committed to doing all it can to protect customers’ information. This includes encouraging customers to change passwords for other accounts if they use the same password for their Dell.com account. Dell will continue to invest in its information technology networks and security to detect and prevent the risk of unauthorized activity.

the importance of protecting customer information. We are writing to inform you about an incident involving one
of our former third-party vendors, Annex Cloud, that previously provided a service only on our website, and which
may involve some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some
steps you can take in response.
Annex Cloud provides a service used by websites that enables individuals to use their user name and password
from other websites, like Facebook and Amazon, to log in to merchants’ websites, including www.francescas.com.
Annex Cloud informed Francesca’s that unauthorized code was detected and has since been removed from the code
used by Annex Cloud to enable logins. In its report to Francesca’s, Annex Cloud identified time periods between
December 28, 2017 and July 9, 2018 when the unauthorized code was or could have been present. If present, the
unauthorized code could have captured information entered during the checkout process including name, address,
email address, Francesca’s account password, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code
(CVV). Through November 8, 2018, Francesca’s sought additional information from Annex Cloud to determine the
transactions that might be involved, and Annex Cloud supplied additional information about their analysis regarding
these periods, including their belief that there are certain times inside these periods where it is not clear if the
unauthorized code was present. Thus, we are notifying you because you entered information during the checkout
process during a time period when it is possible the unauthorized code may have been present.
If you have a Francesca’s account, for your security, we recommend that you reset your password. Please visit
https://www.francescas.com/account/passwordrecovery.do and follow the password reset process. Also, if you
use the same username and password for any other account, we recommend that you change your password
there as well.
We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. You should
immediately report any such charges to the bank that issued your card. If reported timely, payment card network
rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges. Information on additional steps
you can take can be found on the following pages.

occurring in the future, we have removed the Annex Cloud login feature from our website. ", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have received notification from Instagram, then you are among the few who might have been affected by this security breach.
Instagram experienced a serious security breach where a lot of users had their passwords exposed.
This Instagram security issue is associated with the feature that allows users to download their data. The bug associated with Instagram makes passwords visible in URL as plain text, soon after a user requests for the media download. These passwords were also kept at Facebook servers for some reasons.
The feature was introduced to let people keep track of their data that Instagram has kept. The feature is available with “Download your data” option, which lets users get a copy of all their data. This feature was created to abide by the UK’s Data Protection Bill. Once you head up for the action to be performed, Instagram asks you to enter your password, and then you can see this message on your screens,
“We’ve started creating a file of things you have shared on Instagram and will email a link to [your email address]. It may take up to 48 hours to collect this data and send it to you.”
Recently the very link that Instagram shares exposed the users’ password.
Reportedly, Facebook made a notification to all Instagram users about the bug. Also, Instagram clarified that the bug affected only some of the users. Whereas, the chance that their information has been leaked is only there if the user is using a shared computer or a compromised network. Only the users who received notification from Instagram were affected. So you do not have to panic if you haven’t received one. According to Facebook, the issue has been resolved soon after the tool was updated.
If you have been affected by this and received a notification from Instagram already, then here are a few handy tips to protect your account from being exploited. You can turn on your two-factor authentication to protect your account.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,131.55000305175778,140.19000244140622,148.3000030517578,162.5,160.47000122070312,178.77999877929688,185.3000030517578,189.00999450683602,201.8000030517578,183.6999969482422,188.0800018310547,190.38999938964844,197.3999938964844,145.0,132.75555555555556

LPL Financial LLC works with your financial advisor and is the broker-dealer and custodian for your
accounts. In this role, protecting the privacy of your personal information is a top priority. Regrettably,
we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that has occurred at one of our service providers,
Capital Forensics, Inc., that may have involved some of that information. This notice describes the
incident, the measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response, including taking
advantage of credit monitoring and identity protection services at no charge to you.
What Happened
Capital Forensics is a firm that provides consulting and data analysis to assist firms with regulatory,
compliance, and risk management activities. On November 1, 2018, Capital Forensics notified LPL that,
on the same day, an unauthorized person appears to have gained access to a single Capital Forensics
user’s account on a third party file-sharing system it uses to share data with customers, including LPL.
Capital Forensics reported that it promptly secured the Capital Forensics user’s account that same day
but that files containing LPL client information were among the data potentially accessed. Upon
learning this, we immediately launched an investigation and coordinated with Capital Forensics to
ensure that the LPL data, including client information, was removed from that file-sharing system.
What Information Was Involved
Working with Capital Forensics, we conducted a thorough review of the files and determined that the
files included some of your personal information, including your name, account number and Social
Security Number.
What You Can Do
We want to make you aware of the incident and let you know that we are offering you a two-year
membership in AllClear ID at no cost to you. This membership will include two separate services:
identity protection and fraud alerts with credit monitoring. The services are available to you immediately
and you can begin using them at any time during the next 24 months.

Employees across the company received an e-mail notification and apology from co-President Blake Nordstrom on Wednesday informing them of the breach, a company spokesperson confirmed Friday.


Some employees, who may not have regular access to corporate e-mail accounts, were being shown the breach notification by managers when they arrived at work.

The company would not say how many people were affected by the breach; those employees were being notified by mail.

Nordstrom had about 72,500 full- and part-time employees in 2017, according to its last annual financial report. Its ranks swelled to 76,000 in December as it brought on staff to handle seasonal demand.

Some former employees who left the company months ago have received notification letters, according to social-media posts.

No customer data was implicated, according to the Nordstrom spokesperson, who provided a statement that hews closely to the language in the all-employee e-mail, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times.

The company is “investigating an incident where a contract worker improperly handled some Nordstrom employee data,” the statement said.

The company’s information security team discovered the incident, which occurred Oct. 9. The contract worker “no longer has any access to our systems and we’re putting additional measures in place to help prevent this from happening again,” according to the statement. Nordstrom notified law enforcement and began a comprehensive investigation.

“We have no evidence data was shared or used inappropriately,” the company said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying our employees so they can take the appropriate steps to monitor for any potential unauthorized activity.”

There was no information posted to the state  Attorney General’s Data Breach Notifications page about the incident as of early afternoon Friday. State laws require businesses, individuals and public agencies to notify residents who could be harmed by a security breach “in the most expedient time possible” and no more than 45 days after a breach is discovered.

The state Attorney General’s office must be notified if a breach affects more than 500 state residents. The office was reviewing a data breach notice, a spokesman for the Attorney General said Friday.

Some U.S. customers of HBSC HSBC, +0.78% were alerted their accounts had been compromised in a letter dated Nov. 2. Less than 1% of the bank’s U.S. customers were affected by the breach, the company confirmed to BBC on Tuesday.

“HSBC regrets this incident, and we take our responsibility for protecting our customers very seriously,” the bank said, according to BBC. “We have notified those customers whose accounts may have experienced unauthorized access, and are offering them one year of credit monitoring and identify theft protection service.”

According to the letter, customer accounts were accessed during the first half of October. This breach included customers’ full names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, account numbers, account types, account balances, transaction histories, and statement histories. Even more data could have been compromised, Jarrod Overson, director of engineering at Mountain View, Calif.-based security firm Shape Security, said. The circumstances of the breach suggest the attackers already had user passwords, he said.

Often hackers will make use of user names and passwords compromised in prior breaches, and plug them into other institutions – a tactic known as an account takeover or “credential stuffing.” Major breaches such as those at Equifax EFX, -0.25%  and Yahoo have given hackers plenty of such user credentials to work with, experts say.

“This is typical for account takeovers due to credential stuffing and, with over 7 billion credential records spilled since 2015, it’s reasonable to assume this could happen to just about anybody,” Overson said.

Since HSBC is based in the U.K., it is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — a set of data-handling rules put forth by European Union regulators that went into effect in May. Companies must disclose breaches within 72 hours or they will be fined €20 million ($24.5 million) or 4% of their global annual revenue.

The perpetrators told the BBC Russian Service that they had details from a total of 120 million accounts, which they were attempting to sell, although there are reasons to be sceptical about that figure.

Facebook said its security had not been compromised.

And the data had probably been obtained through malicious browser extensions.

Facebook added it had taken steps to prevent further accounts being affected.

The BBC understands many of the users whose details have been compromised are based in Ukraine and Russia. However, some are from the UK, US, Brazil and elsewhere.

The hackers offered to sell access for 10 cents (8p) per account. However, their advert has since been taken offline.

""We have contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores,"" said Facebook executive Guy Rosen.

""We have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts.""

Intimate correspondence
The breach first came to light in September, when a post from a user nicknamed FBSaler appeared on an English-language internet forum.

""We sell personal information of Facebook users. Our database includes 120 million accounts,"" the user wrote.

Is Facebook's News Feed fading?
The cyber-security company Digital Shadows examined the claim on behalf of the BBC and confirmed that more than 81,000 of the profiles posted online as a sample contained private messages.

Data from a further 176,000 accounts was also made available, although some of the information - including email addresses and phone numbers - could have been scraped from members who had not hidden it.

The BBC Russian Service contacted five Russian Facebook users whose private messages had been uploaded and confirmed the posts were theirs.

One example included photographs of a recent holiday, another was a chat about a recent Depeche Mode concert, and a third included complaints about a son-in-law.

Image caption
Samples of the data were posted online to attract interest
There was also an intimate correspondence between two lovers.

One of the websites where the data had been published appeared to have been set up in St Petersburg.

Its IP address has also been flagged by the Cybercrime Tracker service. It says the address had been used to spread the LokiBot Trojan, which allows attackers to gain access to user passwords.

Who should be blamed?
Personal shopping assistants, bookmarking applications and even mini-puzzle games are all on offer from various browsers such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox as third-party extensions.

The little icons sit alongside your URL address bar patiently waiting for you to click on them.

According to Facebook, it was one such extension that quietly monitored victims' activity on the platform and sent personal details and private conversations back to the hackers.

Facebook has not named the extensions it believes were involved but says the leak was not its fault.

Independent cyber-experts have told the BBC that if rogue extensions were indeed the cause, the browsers' developers might share some responsibility for failing to vet the programs, assuming they were distributed via their marketplaces.

But the hack is still bad news for Facebook.

The embattled network has had a terrible year for data security and questions will be asked about whether it is proactive enough in responding to situations like this that affect large numbers of people.

The BBC Russian Service emailed the address listed alongside the hacked details, posing as a buyer interested in buying two million accounts' details.

The advertiser was asked whether the breached accounts were the same as those involved in either the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the subsequent security breach revealed in September.

Image caption
The BBC contacted five people who confirmed the private messages were theirs
A reply in English came from someone calling themself John Smith.

He said that the information had nothing to do with either data leak.

He claimed that his hacking group could offer data from 120 million users, of whom 2.7 million were Russians.

But Digital Shadows told the BBC that this claim was doubtful because it was unlikely Facebook would have missed such a large breach.

John Smith did not explain why he had not advertised his services more widely.

And when asked whether the leaks were linked to the Russian state or to the Internet Research Agency - a group of hackers linked to the Kremlin - he replied: ""No.""", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,151.75,140.61000061035156,131.08999633789062,165.7100067138672,162.27999877929688,168.6999969482422,193.02999877929688,177.47000122070312,193.0,192.72999572753903,185.6699981689453,175.80999755859375,193.6199951171875,162.5,154.119375

What Information Was Involved
What We Are Doing
When we first learned of this activity on August 7, we began an investigation and notified federal law enforcement.
We hired an external forensics investigator to conduct an investigation and took steps to further restrict and monitor
access to our systems and to enhance additional security procedures, including through supplemental training for
certain employees. In connection with our efforts to cooperate with federal law enforcement’s work to investigate
and apprehend the unauthorized third parties, federal law enforcement authorities informed us that disclosure of the
incident could jeopardize this effort, and so we have delayed notification until now.

We recently discovered that unauthorized third parties accessed credentials belonging to a limited number of our
employees between May 30 and September 13, 2018. During this period, unauthorized third parties used improperly
obtained employee information to gain access to certain company websites, potentially resulting in unauthorized
access to personal information of policyholders and applicants. Based on our investigation, we have no reason to
believe that our systems or network have been otherwise compromised at this time.
We are providing this notice to you because some of your personal information may have been accessed by
unauthorized third parties. We are separately contacting a limited group of individuals where we know their
information was accessed by the unauthorized third parties.
The personal information that may have been accessed included names, addresses, date of birth, insurance information
(such as application or policy number, types of insurance, premiums, dates of service and claim amounts) and the
last four digits of Social Security numbers. Our investigation has not identified any unauthorized access to your full
Social Security number, driver’s license or state identification card numbers, bank account numbers, or credit or
debit card information. In addition, based on our investigation, the information that may have been accessed did not
involve medications, diagnosis, or treatment plans.

Pharmaceutical Inc. (“BioMarin,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”). We discovered the Incident on June 21, 2018
and, as described below, have worked diligently to determine the nature and scope of the Incident and itsimpact.
The Incident may have exposed your personal information, including your Social Security Number and health
insurance policy number. Please be assured that we are taking steps to address the Incident and to reduce the
risk of similar incidents happening in the future.
What happened:
On June 21, 2018, we discovered that someone (the “attacker”) had accessed two BioMarin email mailboxes,
beginning on June 18, 2018, as a result of a successful phishing attack by which the attacker acquired a temporary
employee’s user ID and password. When we discovered the breach on June 21, we had the temporary employee
change his credentials, thereby preventing further access to the mailboxes. We have so far been unable to
determine for certain whether the attacker extracted any or all of the information in the mailboxes before this
access was terminated, but it is possible.
Since discovering the Incident, we have been working to secure our network, prevent further attacks, and assess
the nature and scope of any personally identifiable information contained in the mailboxes. We recently
discovered that a document containing your name and Social Security Number, and another document containing
your name and health insurance policy number,may have been in at least one of the mailboxes when they were
accessed.
Your Social Security Number:
Because your Social Security Number may have been accessed, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on
your credit files. A fraud alert requires potential creditors to use what the law refers to as “reasonable policies
and procedures” to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. A fraud alert lasts for 90 days. By
callingone of the three credit reporting agencies listed below, you can automatically place an alert with all of the
agencies. You will receive letters from all three, confirming the fraud alert and letting you know how to get a free

We strongly support this active ecosystem. But increasingly, its success depends on users knowing that their data is secure, and on developers having clear rules of the road.

Over the years we’ve continually strengthened our controls and policies in response to regular internal reviews, user feedback and evolving expectations about data privacy and security.

At the beginning of this year, we started an effort called Project Strobe—a root-and-branch review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data and of our philosophy around apps’ data access. This project looked at the operation of our privacy controls, platforms where users were not engaging with our APIs because of concerns around data privacy, areas where developers may have been granted overly broad access, and other areas in which our policies should be tightened.  

We’re announcing the first four findings and actions from this review today.

Finding 1: There are significant challenges in creating and maintaining a successful Google+ product that meets consumers’ expectations. 

Action 1: We are shutting down Google+ for consumers.

Over the years we’ve received feedback that people want to better understand how to control the data they choose to share with apps on Google+. So as part of Project Strobe, one of our first priorities was to closely review all the APIs associated with Google+.  

This review crystallized what we’ve known for a while: that while our engineering teams have put a lot of effort and dedication into building Google+ over the years, it has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption, and has seen limited user interaction with apps. The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement: 90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds.

Our review showed that our Google+ APIs, and the associated controls for consumers, are challenging to develop and maintain. Underlining this, as part of our Project Strobe audit, we discovered a bug in one of the Google+ People APIs:


Users can grant access to their Profile data, and the public Profile information of their friends, to Google+ apps, via the API.

The bug meant that apps also had access to Profile fields that were shared with the user, but not marked as public.  

This data is limited to static, optional Google+ Profile fields including name, email address, occupation, gender and age. (See the full list on our developer site.) It does not include any other data you may have posted or connected to Google+ or any other service, like Google+ posts, messages, Google account data, phone numbers or G Suite content.

We discovered and immediately patched this bug in March 2018. We believe it occurred after launch as a result of the API’s interaction with a subsequent Google+ code change.

We made Google+ with privacy in mind and therefore keep this API’s log data for only two weeks. That means we cannot confirm which users were impacted by this bug. However, we ran a detailed analysis over the two weeks prior to patching the bug, and from that analysis, the Profiles of up to 500,000 Google+ accounts were potentially affected. Our analysis showed that up to 438 applications may have used this API.

We found no evidence that any developer was aware of this bug, or abusing the API, and we found no evidence that any Profile data was misused.

Every year, we send millions of notifications to users about privacy and security bugs and issues. Whenever user data may have been affected, we go beyond our legal requirements and apply several criteria focused on our users in determining whether to provide notice.

Our Privacy & Data Protection Office reviewed this issue, looking at the type of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance.

The review did highlight the significant challenges in creating and maintaining a successful Google+ that meets consumers’ expectations. Given these challenges and the very low usage of the consumer version of Google+, we decided to sunset the consumer version of Google+.

To give people a full opportunity to transition, we will implement this wind-down over a 10-month period, slated for completion by the end of next August. Over the coming months, we will provide consumers with additional information, including ways they can download and migrate their data.

At the same time, we have many enterprise customers who are finding great value in using Google+ within their companies. Our review showed that Google+ is better suited as an enterprise product where co-workers can engage in internal discussions on a secure corporate social network. Enterprise customers can set common access rules, and use central controls, for their entire organization. We’ve decided to focus on our enterprise efforts and will be launching new features purpose-built for businesses. We will share more information in the coming days.  

Finding 2: People want fine-grained controls over the data they share with apps. 

Action 2: We are launching more granular Google Account permissions that will show in individual dialog boxes.

When an app prompts you for access to your Google account data, we always require that you see what data it has asked for, and you must grant it explicit permission.

Going forward, consumers will get more fine-grained control over what account data they choose to share with each app. Instead of seeing all requested permissions in a single screen, apps will have to show you each requested permission, one at a time, within its own dialog box.  For example, if a developer requests access to both calendar entries and Drive documents, you will be able to choose to share one but not the other. Developers can read more on the Google Developer Blog.

This is what the process looks like today when an app requests access to any data in your consumer Google account (you've always been able to choose whether to grant that permission request):

This is what it will look like:

Finding 3: When users grant apps access to their Gmail, they do so with certain use cases in mind.   

Action 3: We are limiting the types of use cases that are permitted.

We are updating our User Data Policy for the consumer Gmail API to limit the apps that may seek permission to access your consumer Gmail data. Only apps directly enhancing email functionality—such as email clients, email backup services and productivity services (e.g., CRM and mail merge services)—will be authorized to access this data. Moreover, these apps will need to agree to new rules on handling Gmail data and will be subject to security assessments. Developers can read more details on the Gmail Developer Blog. (As always, G Suite administrators are in control of their users’ apps.)

You can always review and control which apps have access to your Google account data (including Gmail) within our Security Checkup tool.

Finding 4: When users grant SMS, Contacts and Phone permissions to Android apps, they do so with certain use cases in mind.   

Action 4: We are limiting apps’ ability to receive Call Log and SMS permissions on Android devices, and are no longer making contact interaction data available via the Android Contacts API.

Some Android apps ask for permission to access a user’s phone (including call logs) and SMS data. Going forward, Google Play will limit which apps are allowed to ask for these permissions.  Only an app that you’ve selected as your default app for making calls or text messages will be able to make these requests. (There are some exceptions—e.g., voicemail and backup apps.) Developers can find more details in the Google Play Developer Policy Center and in the Help Center.

Additionally, as part of the Android Contacts permission, we had provided basic interaction data—so, for example, a messaging app could show you your most recent contacts. We will remove access to contact interaction data from the Android Contacts API within the next few months.

In the coming months, we’ll roll out additional controls and update policies across more of our APIs. As we do so, we’ll work with our developer partners to give them appropriate time to adjust and update their apps and services.

Our goal is to support a wide range of useful apps, while ensuring that everyone is confident that their data is secure. By giving developers more explicit rules of the road, and helping users control your data, we can ensure that we keep doing just that.", ,,ND,,,,,,,4:18-cv-06245-JSW,,Pomerantz LLP,0.0,1155.9200439453125,1108.239990234375,1046.5799560546877,1075.9200439453123,1105.9100341796877,1150.8499755859375,1208.280029296875,1178.8599853515625,1068.3699951171877,1116.7900390625,1175.9100341796875,1206.3199462890625,1208.25,1350.0,1334.4444444444443

The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company’s 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook’s code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them.

The news could not have come at a worse time for Facebook. It has been buffeted over the last year by scandal, from revelations that a British analytics firm got access to the private information of up to 87 million users to worries that disinformation on Facebook has affected elections and even led to deaths in several countries.

Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.

“This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia and one of Facebook’s most vocal critics in Congress, said in a statement. “A full investigation should be swiftly conducted and made public so that we can understand more about what happened.”

In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state.

Three software flaws in Facebook’s systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook.

The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos.

Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages.

“We’re taking it really seriously,” Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. “I’m glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.”

Critics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems.

“Breaches don’t just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,” Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. “The cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.”

Facebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election.

Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November.

In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users.

Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing.

Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site’s “View As” feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy.

The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook’s video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens — digital keys that allow access to an account.

It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.

The hackers also tried to harvest people’s private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook’s systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers’ access to third-party accounts, he said.

Facebook has been reshuffling its security teams since Alex Stamos, its chief security officer, left in August for a teaching position at Stanford University. Instead of acting as a stand-alone group, security team members now work more closely with product teams across the company. The move, the company said, is an effort to embed security across every step of Facebook product development.

Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.

Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services.

“This has really shown us that because today’s digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform — especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook — can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,” said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing.

As the news of Facebook’s data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook.

Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network.

“We removed this post because it looked like spam to us,” the notice said.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680119000009/0001326801-19-000009-index.htm,Risk Factors | Legal Proceedings | Footnotes,2019-01-31 00:00:00,"For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook.

In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission, U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions.

Aflac retained third party experts to help investigate unusual email account activity, which
occurred on various dates between approximately September 8, 2017 and May 9, 2018.
Aflac took prompt action on those accounts after detecting the unusual activity at the time,
including resetting passwords, isolating specific email accounts and enhancing security
measures. Aflac launched an extensive forensic investigation to assess if and how our
customers’ information may have been accessed as a result of the unusual email account
activity. On August 2, 2018, for some sales agents’ accounts, Aflac determined that further
tools and analysis could not conclusively rule out access to the accounts. Therefore, as a
company that cares about its customers and their privacy, and in an abundance of caution
we are reaching out to potentially affected individuals identified as a result of our internal
review. Aflac is not aware of any misuse of your personal or health information at this time.

and education to the agents.
What Information Was Involved?
Based on data analysis which was completed in September 2018, the information in some
accounts may have included the following: first and last name, home address, date of birth,
policy/certificate number, group number, type of policy (such as life, hospital, and dental) and
social security number. Some general health information as part of the application, enrollment

(“TINA”), which is headquartered in Columbus, Ind. and provides administrative services to its affiliated North American entities, is notifying individuals of a data security incident. The incident could potentially impact the security of certain personal and protected health information regarding approximately 19,000 current/former employees and health plan participants of the TINA family of companies. While the company is not aware of any actual harm to individuals as a result of the situation, it is providing potentially affected individuals with information via First Class mail regarding steps taken, and what can be done to protect against potential harm.

What Happened

On August 30, 2018, the company discovered that on or around August 15, 2018, an unauthorized third party may have accessed the company email system and potentially gained entry to a small number of email accounts. After discovering the incident, the company took prompt action to contain the threat, including engaging information security experts to secure the email system and help ensure that the unauthorized third party no longer had access. The company also obtained legal assistance and began a review of the incident, which included contacting technology experts to determine what, if any, information may have been accessed. At this point, the company is not aware of any misuse of personal information because of this incident, and to date, the company has no evidence that this data was removed from its systems.

What Information Was Involved

Employee, former employee and plan participant information that the unauthorized third party may have accessed may include: full name, home address, date of birth, phone number, financial account information, social security number, photograph of social security card, driver’s license number, photograph of driver’s license, email address, photograph of birth certificate, photograph of passport, treatment information, prescription information, diagnoses, health plan beneficiary number and portal username, password and security questions.

What the Company is Doing

The company took prompt action to investigate the incident as soon as it was discovered and engaged legal and information security experts to assist. In addition to the security measures already in place, the company is also reviewing additional options to enhance its training, technology and security practices to reduce the risk of a similar threat, including requiring multifactor authentication, implementing real-time security monitoring enhancements and revising and redistributing mandatory password protection and reset policies. Additionally, the company is alerting its self-funded health plans’ third-party administrator and notified the three largest nationwide consumer reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion – of the incident.

While there is no indication that any individual has suffered harm as a result of the situation, the company recognizes the concern the incident may cause and has arranged for potentially affected individuals to receive complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection for one year.

What Affected Individuals Can Do

Besides using the complimentary credit monitoring and identify theft protection being provided, the company recommends that individuals monitor account statements and free credit reports to detect potential errors resulting from the security incident.

Additional Information

Potentially affected individuals can learn more about this matter by calling the number listed in their mailed notification letter. TINA has a strong commitment to protect personal information, is taking additional steps to enhance data security going forward and apologizes for any concern this situation has caused.

We are writing to tell you about an incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. We take
the protection of your information very seriously and are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances,
steps we are taking in response, and resources we are making available to you.
What Happened?
Wheaton Bank & Trust Company (“WBT”) has discovered that an employee fell victim to an email phishing attack
on August 22, 2018. Upon discovering this incident, we took immediate action to lock down the impacted email
account, investigate the incident, and confirm that no other WBT systems were affected. At this time, there is no
indication that information regarding any WBT accounts (or accounts that you may have with an affiliated bank
listed on the next page of this letter) was the subject of financial fraud. However, in an abundance of caution, we
are providing this notice because certain of your account information was accessible through the impacted
employee email account.
What Information Was Involved?
Information that may have been accessible through the impacted email account includes names and financial
account numbers. Your Social Security numbers and account passwords were NOT impacted.
What We Are Doing.
Upon discovery of the phishing attack, the WBT cybersecurity team conducted a forensic investigation and
confirmed that no other enterprise systems were impacted. We will also continue to provide regular reminders
and training for employees on how to spot and avoid being victimized by phishing emails in the future.
What You Can Do.
While WBT’s policies require additional account credentials or verification to access funds in an account beyond
merely a name and account number, you should nonetheless remain vigilant in reviewing your account
information and be wary of potential phishing schemes. Always remember, our representatives will never ask you
to reveal your password or PIN, and we will never send emails that prompt you to update or confirm sensitive
personal information. If you have any concerns about the validity of a communication that appears to be from us,
you can always contact your WBT representative or your local branch office to confirm.
We want to make sure you are aware of steps you may take to guard against potential identity theft or fraud. Please
review the enclosed “Important Identity Theft Information” for information about what you can do. In addition, please
continue to review the materials we send you periodically containing tips and guidelines for safeguarding your personal
information. This information is also available on our website at https://www.wintrustbank.com/personal/resources

Regulation FD Disclosure.

In connection with the disclosure of the security incident discussed in Item 8.01 below, on September 25, 2018, Chegg, Inc. (the “Company” or “Chegg”) reaffirmed its previous guidance for the third quarter of 2018 as most recently stated in the press release issued on July 30, 2018 and furnished as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8‑K filed that day with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (the “July Guidance”).  Chegg also announced that it currently believes that the security incident discussed in Item 8.01 below will not have a material impact on its financial results for the full year ending December 31, 2018.

The information contained in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information contained in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed by Chegg with the SEC, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report on Form 8‑K, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Item 8.01    Other Events.

On September 19, 2018, Chegg learned that on or around April 29, 2018, an unauthorized party gained access to a Company database that hosts user data for chegg.com and certain of the Company’s family of brands such as EasyBib. The Company understands that the information that may have been obtained could include a Chegg user’s name, email address, shipping address, Chegg username, and hashed Chegg password. The investigation into the incident, which is supported by third-party forensics, is ongoing. To date, the Company understands that no social security numbers or financial information such as users’ credit card numbers or bank account information were obtained. The Company expects to start notifying approximately 40 million active and inactive registered users and certain regulatory authorities on September 26, 2018.

Chegg takes the security of its users’ information seriously and will be initiating a password reset process for all user accounts.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495418000187/0001364954-18-000187-index.htm,2018-09-25 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495418000200/0001364954-18-000200-index.htm,Risk Factors | Legal Proceedings | Footnotes,2018-10-29 00:00:00,"In addition, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue, and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches. For instance, following the Data Incident, a purported securities class action captioned Shah v. Chegg, Inc. et. al. (Case No. 3:18-cv-05956-CRB) was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its CEO.  The complaint was filed by a purported Company shareholder and alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly misleading statements regarding the Company’s security measures to protect users’ data and related internal controls and procedures, as well as the Company’s second quarter 2018 financial results. For further information on such action, see Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” above. Such litigation, regulatory investigations and our technical activities intended to prevent future security breaches are likely to require additional management resources and expenditures.

On August 9, 2018, our ongoing forensic investigation into a potential security incident determined that
unauthorized person(s) gained access to an employee’s email account over a one-hour period on July 10, 2018. Our
investigation began on July 10, 2018, when an internal systems alert detected suspicious activity. We immediately
secured the email account and engaged a leading cyber security firm to assist with the investigation. The investigation
confirmed that a small number of emails were viewed by the unauthorized person(s), but was unable to determine the
full extent of information that may have been accessed. We therefore reviewed the entire contents of the account and
determined that the account contains an email or attachment with your <<Variable Data>>.
We have no indication that your information has been misused or that any financial fraud has resulted from this
incident. However, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized
activity. You should also review the additional information on the following pages on ways to protect yourself.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident. To help prevent something like this from happening
in the future we are adding additional technical safeguards, including implementing multi-factor authentication and
restricting email access outside of FFB’s environment. We are also providing additional security training for our

Notice of Data Breach
We are writing to you because of an incident at Performance Food Group, Inc. (“PFG”),
specifically within the PFG Customized segment (“PFG Customized”).
What Happened
On August 20, 2018, we learned that an unauthorized individual took advantage of
vulnerability in the configuration of the app that PFG uses for PFG Customized team members to
access their email remotely. As a result, we have reason to believe that one or more
unauthorized individuals may have accessed email of current and former employees dating as far
back as 2011. Because we cannot be certain who within the PFG Customized segment may have
been affected, we are notifying all current and former PFG Customized employees out of an
abundance of caution.
What Information was Involved
We do not have specific detail about the information that may have been affected, but it
is possible that the following may have been affected: name, address, Social Security number,
and driver’s license number.
What We Are Doing
In addition to providing you this notice, we have notified law enforcement and have been
working with the FBI and local law enforcement to investigate this incident. This notice has not
been delayed by a law enforcement investigation.
Furthermore, promptly following discovery of the system vulnerability, we made changes
to the remote access system to prevent further unauthorized access, and we required all
employees to update their passwords.

What Happened? On July 2, 2018, Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc. (""RRTS"") became aware that they were the subject of a phishing campaign attack and that several employees had inadvertently clicked on the phishing email. RRTS immediately commenced an investigation into this activity to determine what happened and what information may be affected. This investigation included working with third party forensic investigators to confirm the nature and scope of this incident. Through the investigation, we determined that there was unauthorized access to several employee email accounts in April 2018. It is believed that this access occurred after the employees received phishing emails. On August 13, 2018, the results of the data mining of those accounts was completed and the affected population was identified.

What Information Was Involved? A review of the email accounts determined that information related to this incident varied from individual to individual. This information may have included individual names, addresses, Social Security numbers, financial account information, medical and insurance information as well as other types of identifying or sensitive information.

What is Roadrunner Doing? The confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information is one of our highest priorities. Upon learning of the event, we immediately commenced an investigation to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and to identify what information may be affected. We also took steps to prevent further unauthorized access to the email accounts by changing passwords. While we have measures in place to protect information in our systems, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures.

We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to your personal
information. On July 18, 2018, Guardant Health discovered that one of our employee’s email accounts was
compromised by an unauthorized third party. Upon discovery, we began an investigation and took steps to stop the
unauthorized access into our systems. We immediately engaged a leading cyber forensics firm to help us determine
whether any emails were accessed as a result of this incident. Our investigation revealed that one or more email
messages that included certain personal information belonging to you may have been accessed by the unauthorized
party during a short period of time, between July 13 to July 18.
The following personal information may have been accessed, such as your full name, potentially your social security
number if your insurance company uses it as a subscriber or other identifying number on claim or appeal letters,
date of birth, date of service, home address, diagnosis codes or narratives, Guardant accession number, group
number, doctor’s name and doctor’s NPI number. However, no passwords or financial account information was
accessed. We believe the risk of harm to you is fairly low, but are taking every precaution so that you can monitor
your credit at no cost to you. This letter provides detailed information about what you should do now.
Again, we believe the risk of harm to you is fairly low and we have no evidence that your personal information has
been or will be misused. Nonetheless, we take the protection of your personal information seriously and are taking
steps to prevent a similar occurrence. Due to this incident, we have improved our firewall to block potential future
intruder attempts, have updated employee passwords to be more complex, and educated our employees to be alert
for suspicious email activity. Furthermore, we are working with a leading cyber forensic firm to support our
investigation and provide us with recommendations on additional measures we can implement to prevent a
recurrence of a similar incident.

We engaged an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation of this incident, and while the forensic investigation is still ongoing, it appears that a total of seven such incidents have occurred over the past few months. These incidents have resulted in the unauthorized access of certain information relating to an aggregate of approximately 1,700 individuals. For approximately 1,100 of these individuals, the information accessed included PHI and primarily consisted of patients’ names, contact information, birth dates, medical diagnosis codes and, in a very limited number of cases, Social Security numbers. For the remaining individuals, information accessed did not include PHI and primarily consisted of Social Security numbers and certain other personal financial information, and credit card information in one of the incidents. We have provided or will be providing timely notices to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, certain state regulators and certain credit agencies, as applicable, as well as to the individuals affected. As a result of these incidents, we may also be subject to penalties, such as those described above, as well as other internal and external costs, including those relating to mitigation of the incident.

Re: Notice of Data Event
Our firm represents Sterling National Bank (“Sterling”), 21 Scarsdale Road, Yonkers, NY 10707. We write
to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of personal information relating to
approximately one (1) Maryland resident. The investigation into this event is ongoing and this notice will
be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this
notice, Sterling does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the
applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.
Nature of the Data Event
On or around May 17, 2018, Sterling learned of unusual activity in an employee’s email account. Sterling
immediately took steps to investigate the incident, restore the security of the email account, and determine
whether sensitive information may have been present in the emails affected by this incident.
Through the investigation, which is ongoing and included working with third party forensic investigators,
Sterling determined it was the subject of an email phishing attack and that there was unauthorized access
to the impacted Sterling employee’s email account between May 3, 2018 and May 18, 2018. The
investigation also determined that the affected emails contained certain sensitive information related to
Sterling customers.
While the affected information varies by individual, the data related to the Maryland resident that was
present in the affected emails includes Maryland driver’s license number, in addition to the following types
of sensitive information: loan information, payment terms, title certificate, and vehicle identification
number. To date, Sterling has no evidence to suggest that any information potentially affected by this
incident was subject to actual or attempted misuse.

Notice to Maryland Resident
On August 31, 2018, Sterling will begin mailing written notice of this incident to potentially affected
individuals, which includes approximately one (1) Maryland resident. This notice will be provided in
substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Sterling takes the security of information in its care very seriously. Upon discovering this incident, Sterling
immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event, as well as determine
whose data may potentially be affected. This investigation included working with third party forensic
investigators. While Sterling has safeguards in place to protect data in its care, it is working to implement
additional protections.

Information leaked in the breach comprised 240 million pieces of content related to hotel stay such as name, credit card details, and mobile number, as well as 123 million pieces of registration data recorded on the group's official website such as userID and login pin. Another 130 million pieces of check-in data was leaked, including birthday and home address, according to state-run media China Daily.

Some 13 hotel brands affected in the breach included Crystal Orange Hotel, VUE, and Grand Mercure Hotel. The group reported the incident to the Shanghai police on Tuesday.

Customer data compromised in the security breach popped up for sale on the dark web, reportedly for 8 Bitcoins, or the current equivalent of US$56,158. An advertisement touting the sale offered 141.5GB of data.

Brookfield, Wisc.-based Fiserv [NASDAQ:FISV] is a Fortune 500 company with 24,000 employees and $5.7 billion in earnings last year. Its account and transaction processing systems power the Web sites for hundreds of financial institutions — mostly small community banks and credit unions. According to FedFis.com, Fiserv is by far the top bank core processor, with more than 37 percent market share.



Two weeks ago this author heard from security researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen, who said he’d discovered something curious while logged in to an account at a tiny local bank that uses Fiserv’s platform.

Hermansen had signed up to get email alerts any time a new transaction posted to his account, and he noticed the site assigned his alert a specific “event number.” Working on a hunch that these event numbers might be assigned sequentially and that other records might be available if requested directly, Hermansen requested the same page again but first edited the site’s code in his browser so that his event number was decremented by one digit.

In an instant, he could then view and edit alerts previously set up by another bank customer, and could see that customer’s email address, phone number and full bank account number.

Hermansen said a cybercriminal could abuse this access to enumerate all other accounts with activity alerts on file, and to add or delete phone numbers or email addresses to receive alerts about account transactions.

This would allow any customer of the bank to spy on the daily transaction activity of other customers, and perhaps even target customers who signed up for high minimum balance alerts (e.g., “alert me when the available balance goes below $5,000”).

“I shouldn’t be able to see this data,” Hermansen said. “Anytime you spend money that should be a private transaction between you and your bank, not available for everyone else to see.”

“I shouldn’t be able to see this data,” Hermansen said. “Anytime you spend money that should be a private transaction between you and your bank, not available for everyone else to see.”

Hermansen said he told his bank about what he found, and that he tried unsuccessfully to get the attention of different Fiserv employees, including the company’s CEO via LinkedIn. But he wasn’t sure whether the flaw he found existed in all bank sites running on Fiserv’s ebanking platform, or just his bank’s installation.

Naturally, KrebsOnSecurity offered to help figure that out, and to get Fiserv’s attention, if warranted. Over the past week I signed up for accounts at two small local banks that each use Fiserv’s online banking platform.

In both cases I was able to replicate Hermansen’s findings and view email addresses, phone numbers, partial account numbers and alert details for other customers of each bank just by editing a single digit in a Web page request. I was relieved to find I could not use my online account access at one bank to view transaction alerts I’d set up at a different Fiserv affiliated bank.


A single digit changed in a Web browser request caused someone else’s alerts to pop up in my account at this small local bank in Virginia.

But it was not difficult to find hundreds of other Fiserv-affiliated banks that would be just as vulnerable. If a bank is using Fiserv’s platform, it usually says so somewhere at the bottom of the bank’s home page. Another giveaway is that most of the bank sites using Fiserv display the same root domain name in the browser address bar after login: secureinternetbank.com.

Fiserv said in a statement that the problem stemmed from an issue with “a messaging solution available to a subset of online banking clients.” Fiserv declined to say exactly how many financial institutions may have been impacted overall. But experts tell KrebsOnSecurity that some 1,700 banks currently use Fiserv’s retail (consumer-focused) banking platform alone.

“Fiserv places a high priority on security, and we have responded accordingly,” Fiserv spokesperson Ann Cave said. “After receiving your email, we promptly engaged appropriate resources and worked around the clock to research and remediate the situation. We developed a security patch within 24 hours of receiving notification and deployed the patch to clients that utilize a hosted version of the solution. We will be deploying the patch this evening to clients that utilize an in-house version of the solution.”

This author confirmed that Fiserv no longer shows a sequential event number in their banking sites and has replaced them with a pseudo-random string.

Julie Conroy, research director with market analyst firm Aite Group, said the kinds of banks that use Fiserv’s platform mostly are those that can’t afford to build and maintain their own.

“These financial institutions use a core banking provider like Fiserv because they don’t have the wherewithal to do it on their own, so they’re really trusting Fiserv to do this on their behalf,” Conroy said. “This will not only reflect on Fiserv’s brand, but also it will impact customer’s perception about their small local bank, which is already struggling to compete with the larger, nationwide institutions.”

Allen Weinberg, partner and co-founder at Glenbrook Partners LLC, said the ability of fraudsters to edit account transaction alerts somewhat negates the value of these alerts in helping consumers fight fraud tied to their online banking accounts.

“If a fraudster can just turn off the alerts, there’s one less protection that consumers think they have,” Weinberg said. “I think consumers do rely in large part on these alerts to help them detect fraudulent activity.”

The weaknesses in Fiserv’s platform is what’s known as an “information disclosure” vulnerability. While these are among the most common types of security issues with Web sites, they are also perhaps the most preventable and easily fixed.

Nevertheless, disclosure flaws can be just as damaging to a company’s brand as other more severe types of security errors. Other notable security incidents involving recent information disclosure issues include a weakness at Panera Bread’s site that exposed tens of millions of customer records, and a bug in identity protection service LifeLock’s site that revealed email addresses for millions of customers.

Also updated the story to reflect screen shots shared with KrebsOnSecurity indicating Hermansen was able to see full customer account numbers in his bank’s implementation of Fiserv’s platform.

In its original announcement, the company said: “no passwords were compromised.”

When I asked why the company used that wording, the spokesperson said in a message: “Because they weren’t [compromised]. They were encrypted.”

The spokesperson declined to specify how those passwords were encrypted, or what hashing algorithm was used. Hours after this story was published, security researcher Nicholas Ceraolo reached out claiming that the data exposed in the breach was more than what T-Mobile disclosed. The researcher shared a sample of allegedly compromised data that included a field called “userpassword” and what looks like a hash, which is a cryptographic representations of a password. (Ceraolo said he was not involved in the hack but obtained the sample from a ""mutual friend."")

According to two different security researchers, with whom Motherboard shared that hash, it may be an encoded string hashed with the notoriously weak algorithm called MD5, which can potentially be cracked with brute-forcing attacks.

Jeremi M. Gosney, a well-known password expert and CEO of the password-cracking firm Terahash,

analyzed the hash for Motherboard. Gosney said that while the hash algorithm is not totally clear, algorithm could likely be reverse engineered with access to a larger sample of hashes from the database.

Customers should assume their passwords have already been cracked and should change it, he told me in an online chat.

T-Mobile's CEO John Legere said in a tweet that ""it’s always a good idea to regularly change account passwords.""

The original story follows.

On late Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that hackers stole some of the personal data of 2 million people in a new data breach.

In a brief intrusion, hackers stole ""some"" customer data including names, email addresses, account numbers, and other billing information. The good news is that they did not get credit card numbers, social security numbers, according to the company.

In its announcement, T-Mobile said that its cybersecurity team detected an “unauthorized capture of some information” on Monday, Aug. 20.

“Our cyber-security team discovered and shut down an unauthorized access to certain information, including yours, and we promptly reported it to authorities. None of your financial data (including credit card information) or social security numbers were involved, and no passwords were compromised” the announcement published on the company’s website read. “However, you should know that some of your personal information may have been exposed, which may have included one or more of the following: name, billing zip code, phone number, email address, account number and account type (prepaid or postpaid).”

A company spokesperson told me that the breach affected “about” or “slightly less than” 3% of its 77 million customers.

“Fortunately not many,” the spokesperson said in a text message, adding she could not disclose the exact number.


The spokesperson added that the “incident” happened “early in the morning on Aug. 20,” when hackers part of “an international group” accessed company servers through an API that “didn’t contain any financial data or other very sensitive data.”

According to the spokesperson, on the same day of the intrusion, the cybersecurity team detected it.

“We found it quickly and shut it down very fast,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said she couldn’t give “specifics” of the attack and did not know whether the hackers were criminals or part of a government.

T-Mobile is reaching out to victims directly via text message to notify them, she said.

The company wrote in the announcement that “all affected customers have been, or shortly will be, notified. If you don’t receive a notification than that means your account was not among those impacted by this incident.” T-Mobile also encouraged customers to contact customer service through 611 if they were concerned.

This is the latest in a seemingly endless series of security incidents for T-Mobile in the last year. In October of 2017, Motherboard revealed that hackers had found a nasty bug in a company website that allowed them to look up customers’ personal data just by having their phone numbers. The criminals used it to access customers’ personal information, leveraging it to steal cell phone numbers in the increasingly pervasive scam known as SIM swapping, or SIM hijacking.

T-Mobile initially said it had “found no evidence of customer accounts affected,” but that turned out not to be accurate. Days later, T-Mobile alerted “a few hundred customers” who had been targeted by hackers. Then, in February of this year, T-Mobile sent out a mass text warning customers of the threat of SIM swapping.

In February, a security researcher reported a “critical” bug in another T-Mobile site that would’ve allowed hackers to hijack customer’s accounts. It was fixed before anyone exploited it, according to the company.

Also, in 2015, T-Mobile was breached and lost the personal data—this time including social security numbers—of 15 million people.

been inappropriately accessed or used by a third party who obtained your MG login credentials through
a phishing attack. The perpetrators may have accessed or otherwise obtained your name, MG username

Specifically, our investigation has revealed that on or about July 24 and 26, a phishing email was
sent by a third party to MG employees asking recipients to complete a survey that required employees to
provide their usernames and passwords. If an employee provided their username and password, the
perpetrators used the credentials to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to the employee's
UltiPro payroll account, MG email account, and other applications. Once the perpetrators were able to
gain access to these accounts, they were able to view your contact information, bank account numbers,
basic employment and income information, W-2 information (including your Social Security number if
contained therein), and any other information visible through your UltiPro account.
Once we learned of the breach, we restricted access to those online accounts which we know
were impacted – including yours – and took steps to ensure that all employees changed their passwords
immediately. In addition, we restored the information in your accounts back to the way they were prior
to the attack and flagged and are continuing to monitor all impacted accounts to prevent any further
unauthorized account changes. If you have not changed your login password used to access the MG
computer network, please do so immediately.
To protect yourself from potential harm resulting from the breach we encourage you to closely
monitor all of your personal financial information and accounts, all mail (electronic or printed), phone
calls or other contact from individuals not known to you personally, and avoid answering any questions

Reuters Staff

1 MIN READ

(Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc said on Wednesday it was recently notified by federal authorities that guest data from certain of its Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants may have been compromised in a cyber attack incident.

The Olive Garden owner said its systems and networks were unaffected by the incident, as the breach occurred on a legacy system of Cheddar restaurants chain, which was acquired by Darden in 2017.

Information from about 567,000 payment card numbers may have been exposed through affected restaurants in 23 U.S. states between Nov. 3, 2017 and Jan. 2, 2018, Darden said.


The company said it had disabled and replaced the legacy system by April 10 as part of the merger integration process.

Two previously unreported vulnerabilities in the high-speed internet service provider’s online customer portal made it easy for even an unsophisticated hacker to access this sensitive information.

After BuzzFeed News reported the findings to Comcast, the company patched the flaws. Spokesperson David McGuire told BuzzFeed News, “We quickly investigated these issues and within hours we blocked both vulnerabilities, eliminating the ability to conduct the actions described by these researchers. We take our customers’ security very seriously, and we have no reason to believe these vulnerabilities were ever used against Comcast customers outside of the research described in this report.”

While Comcast has not found any foul play yet, its review is ongoing.

One of the flaws could be exploited by going to an “in-home authentication” page where customers can pay their bills without signing in. The portal asked customers to verify their account by choosing from one of four partial home addresses it suggested, if the device was (or seemed like it was) connected to the customer’s home network. If a hacker obtained a customer’s IP address and spoofed Comcast using an ""X-forwarded-for"" technique, they could repeatedly refresh this login page to reveal the customer’s location. That’s because each time the page refreshed, three addresses would change, while one address, the correct address, remained the same.

Eventually, the page would show the first digit of the street number and first three letters of the correct street name, while asterisks hid the remaining characters. A hacker could then use IP lookup websites to determine the city, state, and postal code of the partial address.

The former ""in-home authentication"" portal for Comcast customers.

After learning of the vulnerability, Comcast disabled in-home authentication. Now, customers need to manually input personal information to verify their accounts.

This vulnerability was particularly easy to exploit — and use to target someone. It’s simple to obtain someone’s IP address (or “Internet Protocol”), a string of numbers that links your internet activity to the Wi-Fi network you’re using. Web administrators can see the IP addresses of everyone who visits their website. Many forums also disclose users’ IP addresses, along with their usernames. A malicious actor can also send someone a link designed specifically to obtain a target’s IP address.

While an IP address alone is not sensitive information, paired with the knowledge of someone’s internet service provider, it can help a bad actor confirm their target’s specific location. And often, it’s fairly easy to figure out someone’s internet service provider, or ISP, because an area is typically limited to one or two high-speed internet options, thanks to the consolidation of internet companies.

In the second vulnerability that Stevenson discovered, a sign-up page through the website for Comcast’s Authorized Dealers (sales agents stationed at non-Comcast retail locations) revealed the last four digits of customers’ Social Security numbers. Armed with just a customer’s billing address, a hacker could brute-force (in other words, repeatedly try random four-digit combinations until the correct combination is guessed) the last four digits of a customer’s Social Security number. Because the login page did not limit the number of attempts, hackers could use a program that runs until the correct Social Security number is inputted into the form.

After being contacted by BuzzFeed News, Comcast put a strict rate limit on the portal.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,35.400001525878906,36.16999816894531,35.18000030517578,38.29999923706055,37.40999984741211,35.43000030517578,37.68000030517578,38.38000106811523,40.709999084472656,42.7599983215332,41.47999954223633,42.63000106811523,41.72999954223633,,

Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., Aug 5, 2018 – TSMC today provided an update on the Company’s computer virus outbreak on the evening of August 3, which affected a number of computer systems and fab tools in Taiwan. The degree of infection varied by fab. TSMC contained the problem and found a solution, and as of 14:00 Taiwan time, about 80% of the company’s impacted tools have been recovered, and the Company expects full recovery on August 6.

TSMC expects this incident to cause shipment delays and additional costs. We estimate the impact to third quarter revenue to be about three percent, and impact to gross margin to be about one percentage point. The Company is confident shipments delayed in third quarter will be recovered in the fourth quarter 2018, and maintains its forecast of high single-digit revenue growth for 2018 in U.S. dollars given on July 19, 2018.

Most of TSMC’s customers have been notified of this event, and the Company is working closely with customers on their wafer delivery schedule. The details will be communicated with each customer individually over the next few days.

This virus outbreak occurred due to misoperation during the software installation process for a new tool, which caused a virus to spread once the tool was connected to the Company’s computer network. Data integrity and confidential information was not compromised. TSMC has taken actions to close this security gap and further strengthen security measures.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046179/000119312518238914/0001193125-18-238914-index.htm,2018-08-06 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046179/000119312518251028/0001193125-18-251028-index.htm,Footnotes,2018-08-17 00:00:00,"The Company experienced a computer virus outbreak on August 3, 2018, which affected a number of computer systems and fab tools, and consequently impacted wafer production in Taiwan.

A copy of the alert from San Francisco-based Salesforce, which was distributed by email about 6 p.m. on Thursday evening, U.S. Pacific Time, states that the error involved the company's REST application programming interface.

""During a Marketing Cloud release between June 4, 2018, and July 7, a code change was introduced that, in rare cases, could have caused REST API calls to retrieve or write data from one customer's account to another inadvertently,"" according to the alert, a copy of which was obtained by Information Security Media Group. ""Where the issue occurred, the API call may have failed and generated an error message rather than writing or modifying data.""

Salesforce has since posted a knowledge article with a brief overview of the problem.

Bad news for Salesforce customers: The software-as-a-service giant says it does not know if data was inadvertently altered or maliciously tampered with, although says it's seen no evidence of the latter.

""We have no evidence of malicious behavior associated with this issue,"" a Salesforce spokesman tells ISMG.

But the security advisory stops short of saying definitively that such activity did not occur. ""We are unable to confirm if your data was viewed or modified by another customer. As a result, we are notifying all potentially impacted customers who accessed the Marketing Cloud during this period,"" according to its alert.

""While Salesforce continues to conduct additional quality checks and testing in relation to this issue, we recommend that you monitor and review your data carefully to ensure the accuracy of your account,"" it says.


Salesforce's website alert: Email Studio and Predictive Intelligence REST API Issue.
In addition, Salesforce says that any organization whose users accessed its Marketing Cloud Email Studio or Predictive Intelligence products - either via the online user interface or REST API calls - may have had their Marketing Cloud data get corrupted.

Why Wasn't Salesforce Logging Activity?
Incident response expert David Stubley, who heads Edinburgh-based security testing firm and consultancy 7 Elements, says he's surprised that Salesforce cannot tell customers if their data was accessed by others or altered.

""In my opinion, this is below expectations,"" Stubley tells ISMG. ""I am surprised that an organization of this size does not have effective monitoring or logging in place. I would be asking them: What are they going to put in place now?""

Did Salesforce Spot the Problem First?
Salesforce's advisory doesn't state how its security team identified or first heard about the problem. Salesforce has yet to comment on that question to ISMG, as well as if it was logging API calls and if not, whether it plans now to do so.

The company did say that it traced the problem to ""a recent code change introduced during a Marketing Cloud release that modified the way REST API calls were processed in the Marketing Cloud"" and that it was spotted on July 18.

""When the Salesforce security team became aware of the issue on July 18, 2018, an emergency release (eRelease) was issued the same day to resolve the issue,"" it says.

The company then issued its email alert to potentially affected customers 15 days later.

But Stubley says he knows of some U.K.-based Salesforce customers who were warned about the problem via a call from their Salesforce account manager, a day prior to the email alert being distributed. ""Were all clients advised by a phone call or just a selective set?"" he says. ""I can't see justification for a two-tier notification system, you should let all of your customers that are potentially impacted know [at the same time].""

What is Marketing Cloud?

Salesforce Marketing Cloud
Together with sales and service offerings, Salesforce's marketing capabilities have long formed its core triumvirate of key products. The premise of the Marketing Cloud is that it enables Salesforce users to target their business-to-consumer and business-to-business customers using data they've already gathered and stored in their Salesforce CRM system.

""Market with trust and security,"" Salesforce says on its website. ""Whether you have dozens or billions of customers, deliver your personalized messages securely when it matters most.""

What's at Risk?
Salesforce's alert refers to three specific products or services:

REST API: An API, or application programming interface, allows two applications or services to communicate. The advisory says the problem occurred in the Force.com REST API and how it interacted with Marketing Cloud. While the REST API has Force.com - Salesforce's platform-as-a-service product - in its name, ""Force.com is not impacted,"" a Salesforce spokesman says.
Marketing Cloud Email Studio: This is a drag-and-drop tool designed for sending promotional, e-commerce, transactional and triggered emails.
Marketing Cloud Predictive Intelligence: This product is pitched by Salesforce on its website as being a tool ""that allows you to use your customers behavioral data to recommend products both on your website and through email communication.""
Salesforce Advice: 'Review Your Data'
It's not clear if the REST API problems may have exposed personally identifiable information for anyone in Europe.

In theory, Marketing Cloud would have access to Salesforce customers' customer and sales prospect contact details, as well as potentially demographic and other information used to ""segment"" customers for marketing purposes.

The Information Commissioner's Office, which enforces the U.K.'s privacy laws, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it was aware of the security alert and investigating. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, organizations that expose European residents' PII must alert relevant authorities within 72 hours of learning about the potential incident (see Under GDPR, Data Breach Reports in UK Have Quadrupled).", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,141.13999938964844,152.67999267578125,157.25999450683594,136.78999328613278,144.14999389648438,135.55000305175778,155.8699951171875,164.52999877929688,160.50999450683594,161.8300018310547,145.10000610351562,154.1199951171875,145.6999969482422,170.0,169.19354838709674

Identity and payment information – including land line and mobile numbers, national ID numbers, addresses, banks, names and records of calls and other data – was exposed, although there is no evidence that any of the data was used in fraudulent activity, according to a report in Telecompaper, which cited El Espanol.

The company reportedly has fixed the flaw.

“Telefonica cannot at present ascertain the potential impact – that will take time to understand,” said Pravin Kothari, founder and CEO of cloud security provider CipherCloud, who noted that Telefonica is a global top 10 telecom company reporting revenue of more than $53 billion. “Surprisingly, the Telefonica customer data was easily downloadable as an unencrypted spreadsheet.”

According to Kothari, the “moral of the story” is that hackers “will get into any network sooner or later.”

If Telefonica's data had been protected by end-to-end encryption “there would be no breach to report under GDPR,as stolen encrypted data would be unusable,” he said. “Now that GDPR is in effect, the Telefonica customer notifications and follow-up must be done in a compliant and potentially expensive way.”

The Telefonica breach, as well as others that occur in the EU, “now presents the risk of an unknown and potentially expensive GDPR audit,” said Kothari.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,8.859999656677246,8.399999618530272,7.75,8.199999809265138,8.590000152587889,8.760000228881836,8.689999580383299,8.539999961853027,8.930000305175781,8.420000076293945,8.010000228881836,8.300000190734862,8.340000152587889,8.675,9.086750000000002

As part of our ongoing efforts to protect our Member’s account information, we continuously monitor
our system for irregular activity. We are writing to you now because we noticed irregular and/or an
increased number of login attempts on your Dollar Shave Club Account. Transparency and data
protection are two of our most important values, and we want to be sure you have helpful
information. So please read this letter and do not hesitate to reach out to us with any further
questions or concerns you might have – we’re here to help!
What Happened?
Through our routine monitoring and security protocols, our anti-fraud team identified attempts by a
third-party system using email and password combinations to log in to certain Dollar Shave Club
customers’ e-commerce accounts on a few occasions between May 26, 2018 and June 25, 2018.
Once logged in, this unauthorized party changed the email address of the compromised account
(sometimes by one number or letter) and used the account to purchase Dollar Shave Club e-gift
cards and send these e-gift cards to another compromised account. Dollar Shave Club’s tech team
caught this unauthorized activity, blocked the inbound requests of the suspicious IP addresses, and
investigated and confirmed which of the attempts resulted in a login to online accounts and/or
purchase of an e gift card. You are receiving this notice because we determined on July 2, 2018 that
your account credentials were improperly used on our website to purchase e-gift cards between
June 21 and June 25. 
So what does that mean in layman’s terms? Essentially, someone obtained a list of emails and
passwords and then used them on platforms (like ours). Your email and password was among those
that worked and the unauthorized party was able to purchase one or more e-gift cards using your
stored but hashed payment card on your Dollar Shave Club account (meaning that only the last four
digits of your payment card and type of card (e.g., Visa, AMEX) were visible when this occurred).
But, don’t worry – we refunded the e-gift card purchases to the original payment method so that you
do not owe anything as a result of this occurrence, and voided the e-gift codes. This type of event
can occur typically because the user’s chosen password is one that is easy to guess and/or the
username and password combination is used across other online accounts. We offered you some
pro tips on choosing passwords in our password reset email, and are giving those up again below.
What Information Was Involved?
As noted, this incident involved the email address and password combinations that were used to
access your Dollar Shave Club online account, which allows someone to view or update certain
information in your account (including your name, address, email, and phone number), and view the
last four digits of your payment card on file and type of payment card. It also may have allowed the
unauthorized party to purchase e-gift cards from your account and send them to other accounts. We
have verified that no other activity was attempted on your account and no access to full payment
card number was obtained.
What We Are Doing?
Dollar Shave Club takes protection of your information very seriously and, from these and other
efforts, we are taking further steps to help prevent this from happening again. Although Dollar Shave
Club’s systems were not breached (but rather, individual accounts were impacted through the use of
login credentials that a third party had obtained), we immediately disabled impacted accounts as a
precaution. If the email address stored in your account was changed in any way during this time
period, we restored your account to reflect your original email address. If your shipping address was
changed in any way during this time period, we restored your account to reflect your original
shipping address.
We also immediately launched a comprehensive review to investigate and remediate the intrusion,
including (1) blocking all IP addresses where the hacker was located, (2) implementing login
notifications to a consumer if (a) an email address is changed or (b) there's a log-in from an
unrecognized device (i.e., a different IP address); (3) limiting the dollar amount that can be added to
an e-gift card; and (4) filing a complaint with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center.
What You Can Do?
We have several dedicated teams working diligently to ensure that the information members entrust
to Dollar Shave Club remains secure. As a precautionary measure, we encourage you to consider
the following account security recommendations:
• Change your passwords for any other online websites or accounts on which you used the
same or similar information used for your Dollar Shave Club account. Please always use
strong passwords and update them frequently. A strong password generally includes: (1) at
least six characters; (2) a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, special characters
and punctuation; and (3) no commonly used words.
• Review your accounts on other websites for suspicious activity.
• Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer
you to a web page asking for personal information.
• Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails
For More Information.
Safeguarding our members’ personal information is something we take very seriously and we
apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions or need further

BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (“BioMarin,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”). We discovered the Incident
on June 21, 2018 and, as described below, have worked diligently to determine the nature and scope of
the Incident and its impact. The Incident may have exposed your personal information, including your
Social Security Number. Please be assured that we are taking steps to address the Incident and to
reduce the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.
What happened:
On June 21, 2018, we discovered that someone (the “attacker”) had accessed two BioMarin email
mailboxes, beginning on June 18, 2018, as a result of a successful phishing attack by which the attacker
acquired a temporary employee’s user ID and password. When we discovered the breach on June 21,
we had the temporary employee change his credentials, thereby preventing further access to the
mailboxes. We have so far been unable to determine for certain whether the attacker extracted any or
all of the information in the mailboxes before this access was terminated, but it is possible.
Since discovering the Incident, we have been working to secure our network, prevent further attacks,
and assess the nature and scope of any personally identifiable information contained in the mailboxes.
We have determined that a copy of a W-9 dated [DATE], containing your name, address and Social
Security Number may have been in at least one of the mailboxes when they were accessed.
Your Social Security Number:
Because your Social Security Number may have been accessed, we recommend that you place a fraud
alert on your credit files. A fraud alert requires potential creditors to use what the law refers to as
“reasonable policies and procedures” to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. A fraud
alert lasts for 90 days. By calling one of the three credit reporting agencies listed below, you can
automatically place an alert with all of the agencies. You will receive letters from all three, confirming
the fraud alert and letting you know how to get a free copy of your credit report from each.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,102.7300033569336,101.80999755859376,99.41000366210938,99.4499969482422,94.75,93.11000061035156,94.93000030517578,93.98999786376952,94.52999877929688,91.8499984741211,87.16000366210938,80.83999633789062,83.98999786376953,118.0,122.84615384615385

BP has emailed about 60,000 people who applied for jobs in its retail stores since 2008 to notify them they could have had their personal information accessed by hackers. The company originally thought about 10,000 applicants' data had been breached.

The company's online recruitment provider, PageUp, an Australian company with 2.6 million users in 190 countries, first detected the breach on May 23.

BP spokeswoman Anna Radich said the company was initially told only those who had applied for jobs at retail establishments in the last 18 months could have had their name, email and home address, birthday, gender, country of residence, employment details and phone number accessed by an ""unauthorised third party"".

But an email sent out Wednesday to another 50,000 affected BP applicants, which was obtained by Stuff, came after recent revelations from PageUp's forensic investigations found anyone who had applied for jobs at BP retail establishments since 2008 could have had their data compromised. 

Privacy Commissioner John Edwards has been notified of the incident, which affects prospective employees from Kathmandu, Jetstar, Nib insurance, BP, and Downer in the last 10 years.

Privacy Commissioner John Edwards has been notified of the incident, which affects prospective employees from Kathmandu, Jetstar, Nib insurance, BP, and Downer in the last 10 years.
New Zealanders who applied for jobs with Nib health insurance, Downer, Kathmandu, Jetstar and Suncorp New Zealand insurers were warned in mid-June their data was also effected by the security breach. Kathmandu and Jetstar have since cut ties with the company, while Downer disabled its recruitment database and Nib and Suncorp have suspended the service.

PageUp's website said the personal details of references listed on job applications was also affected. 

The company said it was ""confident"" that resumes, financial information, tax file numbers, employee performance reports and employment contracts were not affected by the incident. 

In subsequent forensic investigations it was discovered personal data of employees, or former employees of any company that used the online portal as well as job applicants who had used the portal, may have been affected.

PageUp found names, email addresses, physical addresses, employment details and phone numbers could have been accessed in the cyber security breach. 

The company's statement on the ""data incident"" advised that anyone who had used the job portal prior to 2007 could have also had their password compromised, as ""a small number of PageUp error logs before 2007 may have contained incorrect passwords in clear text"".  

The company advised those with long-standing passwords it would be prudent to change them. 

BP advised past job applicants that ""at this stage there is no evidence the data was extracted, only accessed"".

BP told affected users there was no access their data was ""extracted only accessed"".

The fuel company has recommenced the use of the job portal since independent cybersecurity experts have confirmed it is safe to use.

Office of the Privacy Commissioner spokesman Sam Williams said the Commissioner had been notified by several New Zealand agencies that they may have been affected. 

Williams said it was not yet known whose information was accessed and whether the data was extracted or used.

""We are also aware that the Australian government's Cyber Security Centre is working with PageUp to determine the full extent of the breach, and we await their findings with interest.""

Acknowledging the attack, the GoDaddy-owned (via Host Europe, acquired in 2016) company has advised customers to change their passwords and detailed the extent of the data breach claimed by the hackers.

“While we investigate this data breach, we already know that third parties could have had unauthorised access to the following categories of data: Customer name; Company name; Customer number; Address; E-mail addresses; Phone number; DomainFactory Phone password; Date of birth; Bank name and account number (eg IBAN or BIC); and Schufa score”

The company says it has secured the systems the attacker accessed.

Details of the data breach first emerged via Heise, which viewed the now-deleted forum posts in which the attacker said he had accessed the systems.

Journalist Fabian Scherschel also posted on Twitter (in German) that he was also watching a Twitter thread “in which Lauter #Domainfactory customers ask a hacker about their data because DF does not respond to their requests” (all before DomainFactory's disclosure).

The Heise article said “when he realised that DomainFactory did not want to communicate the fact that he had broken into the company's servers, he disclosed his hack”.

Heise said the attacker used a Dirty Cow variant to access the systems, but that wasn't addressed in DomainFactory's post.

DomainFactory's disclosure puts the date of the data breach as January 28, 2018. ®

Update: Call it a cruel irony and we won't disagree: it turns out that Domainfactory misconfigured an error log, causing it to be published as an XML field, which would have simplified the attacker's task considerably.

In this https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Wegen-DSGVO-Panne-Domainfactory-Kundendaten-waren-als-XML-Feed-offen-im-Netz-4107074.html follow-up from Heise (in German), if a was saving updated data and there was an error, that record got published to the feed.

The problem field? “Ironically, the very field that should save the customer's attention to the customer's DSGVO (GDPR in English) declaration was the problem - it expected Boolean data, but was filled with a string.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,74.72000122070312,76.26000213623047,80.3499984741211,75.97000122070312,66.87000274658203,63.72000122070313,63.09000015258789,69.5,73.12000274658203,74.9800033569336,78.69999694824219,73.19999694824219,70.33000183105469,87.0,86.72727272727273

Macy's is warning customers that the retailer discovered a cyber threat that targeted customer profiles for almost two months.

According to a letter mailed to macys.com customers this week, Macy's cyber threat alert tools detected suspicious login activities on June 11.

This ""suspicious activity"" was being done by a third party, who the retailer said obtained the information from a source other than Macy's. From April 26 to June 12, the third party was using valid usernames and passwords to gain access to the customers' accounts.

On June 12, Macy's blocked the profiles that seemed to be breached by the third party.

What customers should do
A macys.com customer account will remain blocked until the customer changes the password associated with the profile, according to the letter. You should've received an email notifying you that your profile was blocked.

If you didn't receive an email, Macy's said to check your junk folder for an email with the subject line ""Important information about your Macy's online profile."" If you can't find the email, Macy's said that your profile still may be blocked and to change the password anyway.

What information was involved
After logging in, the unauthorized party was able to access the customer's full name, address, phone number, email address, birthday and debit or credit card number with expiration dates.

Macy's said macys.com accounts do not include CVV numbers that appear on the backs of credit cards or Social Security numbers.

Macy's suggestions
In the letter, the company said customers should ""remain vigilant"" for fraud and identity theft.

They also suggested that customers contact their debit or credit card companies to tell them about the data breach.

Macy's also said it strongly encourages customers to change the password for any online account for which you used the same username and password as your macys.com account. Because the third party got the information from a source other than Macy's, that information still could be available.


The retailer also said it arranged to have AllClear ID provide a year of free identity protection to affected customers.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,36.88999938964844,38.77999877929688,35.79999923706055,32.830001831054695,36.75,32.419998168945305,29.3799991607666,25.959999084472656,24.3700008392334,25.489999771118164,23.20000076293945,21.059999465942386,21.700000762939453,42.6,41.86666666666667

seriously, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know that there
may have been unauthorized access to your personal details as a result of a recent data security
incident.
What Happened?
In January and February of this year, hackers using ‘phishing’ techniques accessed a number of
Coty employee email accounts. A phishing email is designed to trick recipients into clicking on
a link or revealing their login details. As a result, the emails within those accounts may have
been seen or downloaded. We became aware of the incident on January 12, 2018, and
immediately took steps to stop the hackers, and initiated an investigation to understand what had
happened and the extent of the breach. After thorough analysis, our security experts have
confirmed that the incident has been contained and that the additional security measures we have
implemented will help guard against similar incidents in the future.
What personal data were involved?
Our forensic experts have identified that following information may have been included in the
compromised emails:
• [APPLICABLE PERSONAL DATA]
What we are doing
We have taken steps to reduce the chance of an incident like this occurring again: resetting
global passwords, enhancing processes to identify and block fraudulent emails, modifying access
policies, conducting forensics with external security partners, taking steps to identify and remove
malware from its computers, and internally communicating with Coty employees and leadership
to reemphasize the need for vigilance against such attacks. We have also reported this incident
to law enforcement in the United States both at the federal and state levels.
What you can do
Our forensic experts have advised that the hackers were primarily targeting corporate financial
information, however you should remain vigilant against incidents of fraud, identity theft and 
potential phishing emails and telephone calls. We would recommend that you also follow these
good security practices:
• Regularly reviewing any credit card or bank account statements that you receive for
unusual or unexpected charges;
• Be aware of potential phishing emails and telephone calls from businesses or institutions
requesting your personal details:
o Avoid opening attachments or clicking links in emails and messages (including
texts and social media messages) from unknown senders;
o Verify the identity of anyone contacting you by phone or email. For example, if
someone contacts you claiming to represent Coty or another organization, you
should ask for their name and then try to call them back through the main
switchboard or publicly available phone number. This is particularly important
whenever anyone that you do not already know contacts you seeking money or
information;
• Change your passwords on other online services, if you re-use the same password;
• Enable multi-factor authentication and other available security measures provided by
your other online services;
• Install anti-virus software and keep it updated; and
• Apply all recommended software patches from operating system and software providers.
To help reassure you, we have made certain credit monitoring and identity restoration services
available to you, free of charge, through Experian. Further details of these services and how to
make use of them are included in the Appendix to this letter and can also be accessed here
[hyperlink].
For residents of the United States or persons with credit cards, bank accounts, and other
commercial relationships in the United States, you may further protect yourself by monitoring
free credit reports available from the major credit reporting agencies, for any indication of
unexpected activity, and by instituting fraud alerts and security freezes on your credit report
profiles. You may also ask for certain information or assistance from state or federal law
enforcement. These measures are described further in the Appendix to this letter.

The ticketing firm admitted a security breach, saying it was caused by malicious software on Inbenta Technologies, a third-party support product.

It added that it had contacted customers thought to be affected by the breach.

A Ticketmaster statement said: ""UK customers who purchased, or attempted to purchase, tickets between February and June 23, 2018 may be affected as well as international customers who purchased, or attempted to purchase, tickets between September 2017 and June 23, 2018.

""Forensic teams and security experts are working around the clock to understand how the data was compromised.""

The firm has set up a website for people who fear they could be affected. The BBC said 40,000 people could have been hit by the breach.

involving unauthorized access to personal information maintained by Willis Towers Watson (WTW), which is an
Amgen vendor.
WHAT HAPPENED
On April 23, 2018, we received a letter from WTW informing us that they had suffered a phishing incident that led
to a breach of security and the potential unauthorized disclosure of personal information on February 21, 2018. The
information that WTW maintained on behalf of Amgen related to claims brought against Amgen in civil litigation
as well as worker’s compensation and workplace injury claims. Your information was among this type of personal
information that was maintained by WTW and could have been disclosed in this incident.
WTW, upon discovering the incident, took action to stop the attack and, working with a leading cybersecurity
firm, undertook an assessment of the possible disclosure of personal information. There is no clear evidence that
your information was viewed or disclosed. Further, according to the cybersecurity firm familiar with the particular
hacking group that is suspected of undertaking the attack against WTW, these particular hackers are not interested
in personal information of individuals, but instead they try to gain access to corporate resources for financial gain
through fraudulent invoicing or vouchers.
While we have no evidence that your personal information was accessed or downloaded from WTW servers, it is
possible that personal information may have been accessed or viewed. Therefore, to comply with «State» state law
and to make sure that we provide you with assistance should you decide you need it, we are notifying you that WTW
is providing you with complimentary credit monitoring.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED
The potential personal information involved included your: Name, Address, Phone Number, Date of the Incident
you reported, Description of the Incident you reported, and, where a claim was paid, the amount that was paid. The
Description of the Incident included a high-level description of the injury you may have suffered.
WHAT ARE WE DOING
As noted above, WTW has engaged a cybersecurity firm, investigated the incident, activated security protocols, and
took steps to enhance account security.
To help protect your identity, WTW is offering you a complimentary one-year membership of TransUnion Credit
Monitoring. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity
protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. Please see the enrollment

We are writing to notify you, a valued member, of a recent incident involving some of your personal
information.
What Happened?
On June 3, 2018 Humana was the target of a sophisticated cyber spoofing attack that occurred on
Humana.com and Go365.com. Your personal information on these websites may have been accessed by the
attackers.
On June 3, 2018 Humana became aware of a significant increase in the number of secure log in errors that
were the result of numerous attempts to log into Humana.com and/or Go365.com from foreign countries.
Humana Cyber Security Operations blocked the offending foreign Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the
websites on June 4, 2018.
The volume of log in attempts to Humana.com and/or Go365.com on June 3, 2018 and June 4, 2018 suggested
that a large and broad-based automated attack had been launched. This was evidenced by the volume of log
in attempts coming from a foreign country. The nature of the attack and observed behaviors indicated the
attacker had a large database of user identifiers (IDs) and corresponding passwords that were being inputted
with the intention of identifying which might be valid on Humana.com and/or Go365.com. The excessive
number of log in failures strongly suggests the ID and password combinations did not originate from Humana.
Humana blocked the foreign addresses by June 4, 2018
Based on the facts, Humana has determined this to be an identity spoofing event. Identity spoofing refers to
the action of assuming (i.e., taking on) the identity of some other entity (human or non-human) and then using
that identity to accomplish a goal, such as use of stolen / spoofed authentication credentials to impersonate a
user.

What Information Was Involved?
Your Humana account may have been compromised during these attacks. We would like to stress that your
Social Security Number and bank account numbers were not disclosed as a result of this incident as it is not
available for display in Humana web portals. The attackers may have gained access to your information on
humana.com and/or go365.com, which includes medical, dental and vision claims, spending account
information and biometric screening information.
Information potentially viewed/accessed could have included:
• Medical, dental, and vision claims including services performed, provider name, dates of service,
charge and paid amounts etc.
• Spending account information such as health saving account spending and balance information, and
• Wellness information including biometric screening information
What We Are Doing?
Humana has implemented controls such as forcing a password reset, deploying new alerts of successful and
failed logins and locked accounts as well as deploying a series of technical controls to enhance web portal
security.
Humana has determined there is no evidence that any data was removed from Humana systems and Humana
Cyber Security Operations continues to monitor the situation.
We encourage you to review other websites where you have log in accounts and consider changing your
password for those accounts. We also encourage you to vary your log in ID and password across all your web
and mobile application accounts.
We know that you may be worried about what took place.
At our expense, to safeguard your information from potential misuse, we have partnered with Equifax® to
provide its Credit WatchTM Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring identity theft protection product for one year at no
charge to you. A description of this product is provided in the attached material, which also contains

information. We regret any concern this incident may have caused. You have privacy rights under a Federal
law that protects your health information. It is important for you to know you can exercise these rights, ask

Tokyo, June 14, 2018 — On June 4, 2018 (EST), we learned that Instinet Europe Limited, an
overseas subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, Inc., recently experienced the impact of a spearphishing
incident that resulted in unauthorized access to the firm’s desktop network.
Instinet, supported by Nomura Group affiliates, responded immediately to the discovery of the
attack by launching an investigation, activating a leading cybersecurity firm, and notifying
appropriate authorities, including law enforcement, to assess and remediate the incident.
Although the investigation is ongoing, there has been no impact to Instinet’s execution and
clearing systems. There is no indication that the unauthorized access continues. There is no
evidence the attacker accessed Instinet’s execution and clearing systems. Regular business
operations have not been disrupted and steps have been taken to further protect Instinet’s
ongoing operations.
This week we learned that some client and employee information was accessed. This led to our
decision to announce the incident today, even though the investigation is ongoing. Instinet will
work closely with clients to assess the potential impact.
Instinet, like all other Nomura Group companies, remains committed to systems security, data
privacy, and the protection of client and employee information",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163653/000119312518255514/0001193125-18-255514-index.htm,2018-08-23 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163653/000119312518201584/0001193125-18-201584-index.htm,Footnotes,2018-06-25 00:00:00,"Cyber security incident

In June 2018, a foreign Nomura subsidiary experienced a cyber incident that resulted in the unauthorized access to certain of its systems including client information. An internal investigation to assess and remediate the incident and inform the appropriate authorities of its occurrence was immediately launched and is currently ongoing. As a result of this incident, Nomura may suffer financial loss through reputational damage, legal liability and enforcement actions and through the cost of additional resources to both remediate this incident and also to enhance and strengthen cybersecurity of other Nomura group companies.

HealthEquity, which handles more than 3.4 million health savings accounts, was breached when an intruder accessed an employee's email.
Sometimes all it takes is one employee to spark a cybersecurity wildfire, as HealthEquity learned this week. The company, which handles more than 3.4 million health savings accounts, suffered a data breach when an unauthorized person accessed an employee's email account.

The incident took place on April 11 and was discovered two days later. When the company learned an employee's email was compromised, it removed access to the mailbox and hired a forensics firm to confirm the breach did not affect other HealthEquity systems.

Security breaches could result in the loss of this sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation, indemnity obligations to our customers, fines and other liabilities, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our members and Network Partners, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services. While we have security measures in place, we have experienced limited data privacy incidents, including several incidents in 2018. As a result, or if our security measures are breached again or unauthorized access to data is otherwise obtained as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, our reputation could be significantly damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur substantial liability which could result in loss of sales and customers. If third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including:
•
possible fines, penalties and damages;
•
reduced demand for our services;
•
an unwillingness of consumers and other data owners to provide us with their payment information;
•
an unwillingness of customers and other data owners to provide us with personal information; and
•
harm to our reputation and brand.

The hacker also sent Motherboard files of what they say is employee and customer information taken from Ticketfly’s database.

“Ticketfly HacKeD By IsHaKdZ,” read the message, according to a screenshot posted on Twitter. “Your Security Down im Not Sorry.”


Ticketfly, which is owned by Eventbrite, took down the site and posted a message saying that the company had been “the target of a cyber incident.” Ticketfly sells tickets for many major nightclubs in the United States, including Brooklyn Bowl and the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC. The websites for those clubs are still down, as is Ticketfly’s main website.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We are working to bring our systems back online as soon as possible,” the company’s sites say.


When reached for comment, the company sent back the exact same statement. The company did not say whether any event tickets were stolen or otherwise compromised.

In an email conversation with Motherboard, the hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of “all database” for Ticketfly and its website. The hacker said they asked for 1 bitcoin to share the details of the vulnerability but did not get a reply. The hacker shared what appears to be two emails between him and a series of Ticketfly employees in which the hacker mentions the vulnerability.

“Hi bill i’m the hacker,” reads the subject of the first purported email, which they shared with Motherboard. “Your database and your file I have it.”

A Ticketfly spokesperson declined to respond when asked whether the hacker had gotten in touch with the company.

The hacker also pointed to a server where they uploaded a series of allegedly hacked files.

Among them, there are several CSV spreadsheet files containing what appear to be personal details of Ticketfly customers and employees, including names, home and email addresses, and phone numbers. Each spreadsheet contains thousands of names. Motherboard is actively trying to confirm the validity of these documents, however some of the names correspond to the real names and email addresses of employees at music venues that use Ticketfly.

The website, used by customers to set up their home internet and cable service, can be tricked into displaying the home address where the router is located, as well as the Wi-Fi name and password.

Two security researchers, Karan Saini and Ryan Stevenson, discovered the bug.

Saini, who previously discovered an Uber two-factor bypass bug and a flaw in India's national biometric database, told ZDNet about the bug.

Only a customer account ID and that customer's house or apartment number is needed -- even though the web form asks for a full address. That information could be grabbed from a discarded bill or obtained from an email. In any case, a determined attacker could simply guess the house or apartment number.

ADVERTISING

ZDNet obtained permission from two Xfinity customers to check their information. We were able to obtain their full address and zip code -- which both customers confirmed.

The site returned the Wi-Fi name and password -- in plaintext -- used to connect to the network for one of the customers who uses an Xfinity router. The other customer was using his own router -- and the site didn't return the Wi-Fi network name or password.

With Watson Supply Chain, IBM can elevate your existing supply chain systems to provide greater visibility, improved transparency and insight into supply chain data and processes and achieve cost savings.

White Papers provided by IBM Watson Supply Chain
The bug returns data even if the Xfinity Wi-Fi is already switched on.

Even when the Wi-Fi password changes, running the details again will return the new Wi-Fi password. There appears to be no way for customers to opt out when using Xfinity hardware.

It's also possible to rename Wi-Fi network names and passwords, temporarily locking users out.

Saini said that it would be nearly impossible to enumerate account numbers.

Although it's not believed the sensitive data can be used to access the router's settings, an attacker could use the information to access the Wi-Fi network within its range. On the network, an attacker could read unencrypted traffic from other users on the network.

Comcast, after publication, removed the option from its website.

Contact the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

Fraud Alert. Add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. You only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. To place a 90-day fraud alert on your credit file, log into the Equifax Member Center and click on the fraud alert tab, visit www.fraudalerts.equifax.com or call the auto fraud line at 1-877-478-7625, and follow the simple prompts. This fraud alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days.

Security Freeze. Place a “security freeze” on your credit account. This means that your credit account cannot be shared with potential creditors. A security freeze can help prevent new account identity theft. If you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or Internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies. Credit reporting agencies charge a $5 fee to place or remove a security freeze, unless you provide proof that you are a victim of identity theft, in which case there is no fee. A copy of your police report or an investigative report or written FTC complaint documenting identity theft must be included to avoid a fee. In your request, you also must include (documentation for both the spouse and the victim must be submitted when requesting for the spouse’s credit report) (i) a copy of either the police report or case number documenting the identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft; (ii) your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.,) address, Social Security number, and date of birth; (iii) if you have moved in the past 5 years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior 5 years; (iv) proof of current address such as a current utility bill or phone bill; (v) a photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver’s license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and, if applicable (vi) payment by check, money order or credit card (Visa, Master Card, American Express or Discover cards only.)

Watch Bills, Statements and Mailing Lists. If you aren’t already doing so, please pay close attention to all bills and credit-card charges you receive for items you did not contract for or purchase. Review all of your bank account statements frequently for checks, purchases or deductions not made by you. Note that even if you do not find suspicious activity initially, you should continue to check this information periodically since identity thieves sometimes hold on to stolen personal information before using it. Remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.

On May 12, 2018, we issued a public statement that malware had been discovered at certain Chili’s restaurants that resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of customer payment card data. We have engaged third-party forensic firms and cooperated with law enforcement to investigate the matter. Based on the investigation of our third-party forensic experts, we believe most Company-owned Chili’s restaurants were impacted by the malware during time frames that vary by restaurant, but we believe in each case beginning no earlier than March 21, 2018 and ending no later than April 22, 2018.
We expect to incur significant investigation, legal and professional services expenses associated with the cyber security incident in future periods. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Related to this incident, payment card companies and associations may request us to reimburse them for unauthorized card charges and costs to replace cards and may also impose fines or penalties in connection with the cyber security incident, and enforcement authorities may also impose fines or other remedies against us. While we do not acknowledge responsibility to pay any such amounts imposed, this may result in related settlement costs. We will record an estimate for losses at the time when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Cyber security incident expenses of $2.0 million have been recorded to Other gains and charges in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, please see Note 3 - Other Gains and Charges for details. To limit our exposure to cyber security events, we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage. This coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure for this incident. We will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under the policies. Our cyber liability insurance policy maintains a $2.0 million retention that was fully accrued as of June 27, 2018.
The Company was named as a defendant in putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and two in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, filed on May 24, 2018, May 30, 2018, June 14, 2018, and June 28, 2018, respectively (collectively, the “Litigation”) relating to the cyber security incident described above. In the Litigation, plaintiffs assert various claims stemming from the cyber security incident at the Company’s Chili’s restaurants involving customer payment card information and seek monetary damages in excess of $5.0 million, injunctive and declaratory relief and attorney’s fees and costs. We believe we have defenses and intend to defend the Litigation. Several government agencies, including State Attorneys General, are inquiring about or investigating events related to the cyber security incident, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses (the “Inquiries”). We are cooperating with the Inquiries, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations. At this point, we are unable to predict the developments in, outcome of, and economic and other consequences of pending or future litigation or regulatory investigations related to, and other costs associated with this matter. As such, as of June 27, 2018, we have concluded that a loss from these matters is not determinable, therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for Litigation or Inquiries, although the ultimate amount paid on claims and settlement costs could be material. We will continue to evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information and future circumstances.",4300000,1900000.0,2000000,	3:18-cv-00686-TJC-MCR,Lowndes Drosdick Doster Kantor & Reed PA | Norton Rose Fulbright,Hannon Law Firm LLC | Morgan & Morgan | Haines & Krieger LLC | Law Office of Jean Sutton Martin PLLC | Knepper & Clark LLC | Sauder Schelkopf LLC,,45.29999923706055,48.209999084472656,48.68999862670898,44.18000030517578,46.33000183105469,44.70000076293945,50.33000183105469,48.18999862670898,49.06999969482422,44.650001525878906,42.93999862670898,42.63999938964844,42.63999938964844,54.0,54.0

On April 26, 2018, Company personnel identified suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the Company’s Stored Value Solutions gift card business. The Company took immediate action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information (these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data). The Company through counsel promptly engaged external experts in information technology forensics to assist in the investigation. The Company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected.
The investigation is in its early stages but indicates that a significant number of six months or older gift card and PIN numbers were accessed. The affected data does not include personally identifiable information (such as consumer names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data). Following discovery, the Company froze certain gift card information and is working with merchant customers to limit the impact of the unauthorized access. The Company did not see any evidence of access to its systems involving fleet cards and other payment products, or to the proprietary and third-party payment networks used to deliver the Company’s payment solutions. The Company continues to investigate its other systems to determine whether any other information or systems have been accessed and whether other customers may have been impacted.

On April 26, 2018, Company personnel identified suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the Company’s Stored Value Solutions gift card business. The Company took immediate action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information (these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data). The Company through counsel has retained three information technology forensic firms, which have been examining the Company’s systems in detail over the approximately two week period since the incident was discovered. The Company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected. As of the date hereof, the Company does not believe that the unauthorized access incident will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations, though the Company’s investigation is ongoing.
Based upon information known as of the date hereof, the Company believes that a significant number of gift card and PIN numbers issued by six Stored Value Solutions customers were accessed. Following discovery, the Company has been working with merchant customers to limit the impact of the unauthorized access. We believe the mitigation steps discussed with merchants, if fully implemented, will severely restrict or eliminate the ability of the bad actors to use the information, while preserving the ability of legitimate holders of the gift cards to use them.
The Company has no evidence of access affecting its systems involving fleet cards and other payment products, or the proprietary and third-party payment networks used to deliver the Company’s payment solutions.
Subsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, legal and other professional expenses related to the unauthorized access incident in future periods. The Company will recognize these expenses as services are received.
The Company maintains insurance coverage to limit its exposure to losses such as those related to the unauthorized access incident.

We are contacting our customers who may have entered their credit card information to make a
purchase on Grainger’s website or mobile app between September 26, 2017 and October 12,
2017. Grainger learned last week that the company it works with to provide its online chat
service, [24]7.ai, had a security breach that might have allowed access to your credit card
information.
It is important to note that neither Grainger nor [24]7.ai have any evidence of unauthorized
transactions or fraud attributable to this matter. However, given our commitment to customer
service, we are providing this notice to all customers who might possibility be affected.
What Happened?
On April 10, 2018, Grainger was notified by [24]7.ai that [24]7.ai was involved in a cyber
incident, which occurred from September 26, 2017 through October 12, 2017. During this time,
credit card information of those conducting business with certain [24]7.ai clients, including
Grainger, may have been accessed. Those customers who used guest check out and manually
entered credit card information on Grainger.com or its app were potentially affected.
You have been identified as a Grainger customer affected by this [24]7.ai incident.
What Information Was Involved?
Information related to this incident includes credit card numbers, security codes, card expiration
dates, names and addresses.
What Grainger is Doing.

cybersecurity protocol by working with a leading cybersecurity expert to conduct its own
investigation, alerting the credit card companies about the situation and affected cards, and
notifying law enforcement officials. Grainger also communicated regularly with [24]7.ai. In
connection with the foregoing, Grainger received assurances from [24]7.ai that the incident was
resolved as of October 12, 2017.

accessed or subsequently compromised, Grainger is offering you the services of Kroll to provide

platform (the “Orbitz platform”) that powered our, and a number of our business partners’, travel sites.
Regrettably, certain hotel reservations that you made through Southwest.com, which was powered by
Orbitz, may have been affected. This notice describes the incident, the measures taken in response, and
some steps you can take to further protect your information.
What Happened?
While conducting an investigation of the Orbitz platform, Orbitz determined on March 1, 2018 there
was evidence suggesting that, between October 1, 2017 and December 22, 2017, an unauthorized
third-party may have accessed certain personal information stored on this consumer and business partner
platform. Orbitz took immediate steps to investigate the incident and enhance security and monitoring of
the affected Orbitz platform, and made every effort to remediate the issue, including taking swift action
to eliminate and prevent additional unauthorized access to the platform. Findings from our investigation
indicate that the information accessed on the Orbitz platform included certain hotel reservations made
through Southwest.com, and powered by Orbitz, during the period from January 1, 2016 to June 23,
2016. This incident did not affect Southwest Airlines' systems nor other travel reservations made
through Southwest.com.
What Information Was Involved?
Orbitz determined that the personal information likely accessed may have included your name, payment
card number and expiration date, phone number, email address, and physical and/or billing address.
What Information was Not Involved?
The Orbitz investigation to date has not found any evidence of unauthorized access to other types of
personal information, including passport and travel itinerary information. Additionally, for U.S.
customers, Orbitz determined that Social Security numbers were not involved in this incident, because
they are not collected nor held on the platform.

On April 17, 2018, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) announced a data security incident involving the compromise of a senior executive’s Company email account. Upon learning of the incident on March 28, 2018, external network security experts were promptly engaged, and the incident response team worked diligently to investigate the incident. The Company also promptly notified federal law enforcement of the incident. The investigation concluded that the incident was limited to the compromise of the senior executive’s Company email account for approximately 11 weeks. The investigation did not reveal any evidence that the Company’s network or other information technology systems were otherwise compromised in connection with the incident or that the incident resulted in the disclosure of or access to personal information about patients or other individuals besides the holder of the Company email account that was affected. However, proprietary, confidential and other sensitive information of the Company and other entities was accessed and may have been compromised as a result of the incident. The Company is continuing to analyze the effects of the incident, along with appropriate remediation of the Company’s information technology systems, and that analysis and the related remediation efforts could ultimately reveal that other Company information technology systems were compromised and/or that additional information was revealed or compromised.

In connection with the data security incident, the Company is also filing information for the purpose of supplementing and updating the risk factor disclosures contained in its prior public filings, including those discussed under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018.

For example, in April 2018, we announced a data security incident involving the compromise of a senior executive’s company email account.

We are continuing to analyze the effects of the incident, along with appropriate remediation of our information technology systems, and that analysis and the related remediation efforts could ultimately reveal that other company information technology systems were compromised and/or that additional information was revealed or compromised. In addition, unforeseen developments related to this incident could occur, which could have a further adverse impact on us. Accordingly, we are still in the process of assessing the financial and other impacts on us and our business resulting from this incident. We do not maintain cyber liability insurance and will therefore have no coverage for any losses resulting from this data security incident. Any litigation or regulatory review arising from this incident could result in significant legal exposure to us.  In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations.

Other Events.

 

On April 13, 2018, the Company also announced that it experienced a data security incident.  Specifically, the Company indicated that messages within an employee email account were accessed by unknown persons outside the Company without authorization. Some of the messages and files attached thereto may have contained personal information belonging to Inogen rental customers.  The Company, with the assistance of outside counsel, immediately took steps to secure customer information and hired a leading forensics firm to investigate the incident and to bolster its security.

 

The forensics firm hired to investigate the incident determined that an unauthorized individual may have gained access to personal information belonging to some Inogen rental customers including their name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, date of death, Medicare identification number, insurance policy information, and/or type of medical equipment provided.  The impacted data did not include payment card information or medical records.  The unauthorized access of the potentially impacted email account appears to have occurred between January 2, 2018 and March 14, 2018.  The Company is notifying approximately 30,000 current and former customers of this incident and will provide resources, including credit monitoring and an insurance reimbursement policy, to assist them.  The Company is also notifying the applicable regulatory authorities.  In addition, the Company determined that the unauthorized individual may have gained access to non-public financial information of the Company.  

 

The Company takes the security of information belonging to its customers very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.  Specifically, the Company has increased the security of Inogen systems by requiring all email users to change their passwords following the incident and sooner than they would have otherwise been required to.  The Company has also implemented multi-factor authentication for remote email access and has taken additional steps to further limit access to its systems and other preventative measures, including but not limited to enhanced training and use of electronic tools.  The Company has insurance coverage in place for certain potential liabilities and costs relating to the incident, but this insurance is limited in amount, subject to a deductible, and may not be adequate to protect against all costs arising from this incident.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1294133/000156459018008092/0001564590-18-008092-index.htm,2018-04-13 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1294133/000156459018009839/0001564590-18-009839-index.htm,Risk Factors,2018-04-30 00:00:00,"We and our vendors and service providers rely on information technology networks and systems, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cybersecurity risks, data security incidents and/or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected.

We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic, customer, operational, compliance, and financial information; to coordinate our business; and to communicate within our company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cybersecurity risks, data security incidents, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Like other companies, we have experienced data security incidents before.  For example, on April 13, 2018, we announced that messages within an employee email account were accessed by unknown persons outside of our company without authorization.  Some of the messages and attached files in that email account contained personal information belonging to our rental customers.  We immediately took steps to secure customer information and hired a leading forensics firm to investigate the incident and to bolster our security.  The unauthorized access of the potentially impacted email account appears to have occurred between January 2, 2018 and March 14, 2018.  We notified approximately 30,000 current and former rental customers of this incident as well as the applicable regulatory authorities.  We also provided resources, including credit monitoring and an insurance reimbursement policy, to assist all potentially affected individuals.  We will incur remedial, legal and other costs in connection with this incident. We have insurance coverage in place for certain potential liabilities and costs relating to the incident, but this insurance is limited in amount, subject to a deductible, and may not be adequate to protect against all costs arising from this incident.

If our information technology networks and systems suffer unauthorized access, severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business does not effectively identify or resolve the issues in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted, we could be subject to regulatory and consumer lawsuits and our business could be negatively affected. In addition, cybersecurity risks and data security incidents could lead to potential unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information (including protected health information), and data loss and corruption. There is no assurance that we will not experience service interruptions, security breaches, cyber security risks and data security incidents, or other information technology failures in the future.

The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and attacks, we have implemented and periodically review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss.  For example, we have recently increased the security of our systems by requiring all email users to change their passwords following our recent data security incident and sooner than they would have otherwise been required to.  We also implemented multi-factor authentication for remote email access and have taken additional steps to further limit access to our systems.  However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.

The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers’, employees’ or business partners’ information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. The costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material.  In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs.",0,,,,,,,137.38999938964844,184.0399932861328,183.4900054931641,201.9600067138672,226.25,274.760009765625,201.4199981689453,139.92999267578122,136.42999267578122,135.80999755859378,138.05000305175778,95.83999633789062,84.83000183105469,180.0,184.6

Their information suggests that the dates for this illegal intrusion were between Sept. 27 and Oct. 12, 2017.

The tech firm found that a cybersecurity incident affected online customer payment information of its clients, it said. The incident happened on or after Sept. 26, 2017, and was found and resolved on Oct. 12 that year.

Delta DAL, +0.65%   and Sears SHLD, +2.77%   said they were notified of the incident last week and that certain customer payment information may have been accessed. Personal details related to passport, government identification, security and SkyMiles information were not impacted, Delta, the second-largest U.S. carrier, said.

Delta said it involved federal law enforcement who confirmed that the incident was resolved last October.

“At this point, even though only a small subset of our customers would have been exposed, we cannot say definitively whether any of our customers’ information was actually accessed or subsequently compromised,” Delta said in a statement.

Sears said the incident led to unauthorized access to the credit card information of under 100,000 of its customers, according to Reuters and other news outlets.

Sears said its stores were not compromised and their internal systems were not accessed in the breach.

Dear <<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>>:
I am writing to make you aware of a data security incident at Thermo Fisher Scientific involving your personal information,
as described below. This letter explains the incident, measures the company has taken and some actions you can take
in response. Thermo Fisher takes information security very seriously and sincerely regrets that this incident occurred and
any concern or inconvenience it may cause you.
What Happened
Thermo Fisher learned from federal law enforcement authorities that unauthorized third parties compromised a small
percentage of the company’s email accounts during some portion of 2017. They advised us that our company was
one of a large number of corporations that this group has targeted and that federal law enforcement authorities were
actively investigating the group. Although the date when the compromise began has not been conclusively determined,
our investigation to date confirms that certain emails from on or about July 6, 2017 through October 13, 2017 were
acquired by unauthorized third parties.
What Information Was Involved
Based on our investigation to date, we believe that your name and social security number were among the
information contained in the affected emails.
We have no indication that any information obtained in this incident was actually viewed by any unauthorized third
party or has been misused.
What We Are Doing
Upon learning of the incident, Thermo Fisher immediately began its own investigation with the assistance of outside
experts and has been working closely with federal law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation of
this incident. The company also promptly took steps to secure the affected accounts, including requiring employees
to change their passwords. In addition, Thermo Fisher has enhanced its email security and expects to continue
to make security enhancements to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Law enforcement
authorities requested that the company delay making any notification of this incident to avoid interference with their
investigation. We are notifying you now, after coordinating with law enforcement, so that you can take the steps
recommended below.
What You Can Do
The company encourages you to remain vigilant and take steps to protect against identity theft or fraud. We recommend
that you monitor your accounts and free credit reports for any signs of suspicious activity. Information about how
to obtain a free credit report, security freezes, and other guidance is provided under “Additional Resources” in the
enclosed document, which we encourage you to review.

BALTIMORE, March 29, 2018 - Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) today announced that it is notifying users of MyFitnessPal - the company’s food and nutrition application and website - about a data security issue. On March 25, the MyFitnessPal team became aware that an unauthorized party acquired data associated with MyFitnessPal user accounts in late February 2018. The company quickly took steps to determine the nature and scope of the issue and to alert the MyFitnessPal community of the incident.

Under Armour is working with leading data security firms to assist in its investigation, and also coordinating with law enforcement authorities. The investigation indicates that the affected information included usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords - the majority with the hashing function called bcrypt used to secure passwords.

The affected data did not include government-issued identifiers (such as Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers), which the company does not collect from users. Payment card data was also not affected because it is collected and processed separately. The company’s investigation is ongoing, but indicates that approximately 150 million user accounts were affected by this issue.

Four days after learning of the issue, the company began notifying the MyFitnessPal community via email and through in-app messaging. The notice contains recommendations for MyFitnessPal users regarding account security steps they can take to help protect their information. The company will be requiring MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords and is urging users to do so immediately.

Although ZDNet has reached out to Boeing for comment, a statement issued to sister site CNET downplays the concerns over the company's production impact.

""A number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate,"" Linda Mills, vice president of Boeing commercial airplanes communications, told CNET.

""Our cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue.""

Claims Boeing had been struck by the virus that caused global panic when it spread last year were made after the company's commercial airplane chief engineer Mike VanderWel distributed a memo to staff that called for ""all hands on deck"".

""It is metastasizing rapidly out of North Charleston and I just heard 777 (automated spar assembly tools) may have gone down,"" the Seattle Times reported VanderWel as writing in the memo. He reportedly added that he was concerned the virus would hit equipment used in functional tests of planes ready to roll out and potentially ""spread to airplane software"".

The WannaCry ransomware, labelled the biggest challenge of 2017, saw ransomware spread with the help of a leaked NSA exploit and infect over 300,000 PCs at major organisations around the globe.

NEW YORK, March 20, 2018 -- 
American Express said today that it has recently been alerted by Expedia that certain customers who used Expedia’s Orbitz platform from January 1, 2016 through December 22, 2017 may have been victims of a cyber attack. The attack involved an Orbitz platform which serves as the underlying booking engine for many online travel websites, including Amextravel.com and travel booked through Amex Travel Representatives.

This was not an attack on, and did not compromise, American Express Global Business Travel or the American Express platforms that Card Members use to manage their American Express Card accounts.

As announced earlier today, Expedia has reported that certain transactions containing personal information made on the Orbitz platform during this time period may have been accessed by an attacker. Expedia also informed the company that the platform has been remediated.

American Express monitors its Card Member accounts for unusual activity and will be elevating fraud monitoring for those accounts that might have been impacted by the Orbitz attack. American Express will be reaching out to its impacted travel customers to provide additional information and support, including two years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.

As always, American Express encourages customers to monitor their card accounts, and if they see any suspicious activity, immediately contact the number on the back of their card. Card Members can enroll for alerts that will notify them of potentially fraudulent activity at americanexpress.com/alerts or through the settings on the American Express smart phone app. Notifications can be received via text messages, through push notifications via the smart phone app and email. Customers can also call the number on the back of their cards for additional support or information.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,94.83999633789062,102.37000274658205,100.98999786376952,97.13999938964844,100.16999816894531,103.83000183105469,110.0999984741211,106.7300033569336,108.25,98.7699966430664,100.4800033569336,106.5,112.66999816894531,110.0,101.92331578947369

The news pushed Expedia shares down 1.5 percent to $109.63 at 2:31 p.m. in New York. In addition to the cards, hackers may have stolen names, dates of birth, phone numbers and addresses of consumers who booked through Orbitz in 2016 and 2017. Orbitz also provides a back-end booking system for other companies, which may also have been affected, Orbitz said in an email. American Express said that could include people who booked through Amextravel.com.


The hack is the latest headache for Expedia stemming from its $1.6 billion acquisition of Orbitz in 2015, a deal that cemented the company’s position as one of two global travel-booking giants, along with Booking Holdings Inc. While Expedia was integrating Orbitz’ back-end system with its own, the network crashed, causing downtime that affected sales enough to cut into quarterly revenue, the company said in July 2016.

Expedia shares have declined more than 8 percent this year as extra spending on improving its HomeAway short-term rental site and marketing its various brands around the world eats into profit. The company is fending off a renewed push from Booking Holdings to market its Booking.com website in the U.S., Expedia’s home turf.

What happened?
In March 2018, Frost detected unauthorized access into a third-party lockbox software program that allowed unauthorized users to view and copy images of checks stored electronically in the image archive. The identified incident did not impact other Frost systems. We have stopped the unauthorized access, and have reported the incident to and are cooperating with law-enforcement authorities. 

Why would someone take this information?
Information from the accessed images can be used to forge checks.

What does this mean for me?
Probably nothing. However, in the unlikely event that you, a Frost customer, experience a forgery on your account, or if you’ve been notified that one of your check images was compromised, please contact us 24/7 at (800) 513-7678. Non-Frost customers should contact their financial institutions.

Who was directly affected?
The unauthorized access was limited to one software program serving about 470 commercial customers who use our electronic lockbox, a fraction of our overall customer base. We’re working with our lockbox customers to support them in taking appropriate actions.

Was my business's lockbox accessed?
If you use lockbox services and view your deposited images online through Treasury Management, there may have been unauthorized access to the image archive. A banker will be reaching out to you directly, or call Treasury Management Customer Service at (888) 481-0336.

Is my money safe?
Yes. Frost’s core operating systems were not affected by the identified unauthorized access. The identified unauthorized access has been stopped, and didn’t ever go beyond the relatively small group of affected customers. It’s always a good practice to be diligent about checking your account regularly for unauthorized activity.

What’s a lockbox?
A lockbox service allows customers to send payments to a central post office box where the bank receives the payments and credits them directly to a business’s account.

Don’t you have protections in place to prevent this kind of thing?
Yes, and those protections have prevented countless attempts to gain access to information. In this case, we discovered the unauthorized access using enhanced detection measures.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/39263/000003926318000023/0000039263-18-000023-index.htm,MDA,2018-04-26 00:00:00,"Other Non-Interest Expense. Other non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $2.1 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2017.

Previously, such network costs were reported as a component of other non-interest expense.

Excluding network costs from the three months ended March 31, 2017, other non-interest expense effectively increased $5.3 million. This increase included increases in donations expense related to a contribution to our charitable foundation (up $3.7 million); professional services expense (up $2.0 million); and outside computer services expense (up $317 thousand), among other things. These items were partly offset by decreases in advertising/promotions expense (down $512 thousand), data communications expense (down $436 thousand) and travel/meals and entertainment expense (down $204 thousand), among other things. The increase in professional services expense during the first quarter of 2018 was partly related to an information systems breach which resulted in unauthorized access to a third-party lockbox software program used by certain of our commercial lockbox customers to store digital images. We have stopped the identified unauthorized access and are working with a leading cybersecurity firm. We have reported the incident to, and are cooperating with, law-enforcement authorities and our investigation is ongoing.

March 2, 2018

RMH Franchise Holdings (“RMH”) recently learned about a data incident affecting certain payment cards used at RMH-owned Applebee’s restaurants that we operate as a franchisee. We are providing this notice to our guests as a precaution to inform them of the incident and to call their attention to some steps they can take to help protect themselves. RMH operates its point-of-sale systems isolated from the broader Applebee’s network, and this notice applies only to RMH-owned Applebee’s restaurants.


What Happened
Upon learning of a potential incident, RMH promptly launched an investigation and obtained the help of leading cyber security forensics firms. Based on the experts’ investigation, RMH believes that unauthorized software placed on the point-of-sale system at certain RMH-owned and -operated Applebee’s restaurants was designed to capture payment card information and may have affected a limited number of purchases made at those locations.


What Information Was Involved
Certain guests’ names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates and card verification codes processed during limited time periods could have been affected. The exact dates vary by location. For a list of affected restaurants and the specific dates related to each location, please see below. Payments made online or using self-pay tabletop devices were not affected by this incident.

Location:


What We Are Doing
The security and privacy of our guests’ payment card data remains a top priority. After discovering the incident on February 13, 2018, RMH promptly took steps to ensure that it had been contained. In addition to engaging third-party cyber security experts to assist with our investigation, RMH also notified law enforcement about the incident and will continue to cooperate in their investigation. Moving forward, RMH is continuing to closely monitor its systems and review its security measures to help prevent something like this from happening again.

RMH is pleased to report that the incident has been contained and guests may use their cards with confidence at the RMH Applebee’s locations that were affected by this incident


What You Can Do
We want to make our guests aware of steps they can take to help protect themselves. As a best practice, it is always advisable for guests to closely monitor their payment card statements. If they see an unauthorized charge, guests should immediately notify the bank that issued the card. Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges.

Additionally, we are providing additional information about identity theft protection, available below, describing steps that guests may take to help protect themselves, including recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on placing a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.


For More Information
For more information about this incident, or if there are additional questions, guests may contact our dedicated call center by calling 888-764-7357 between 9 a.m. – 9 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

Fraud Alerts:  There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud:  an initial alert and an extended alert.  You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.  An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.  You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.  An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.  You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page.

Credit Freezes:  You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.  A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent.  If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.  Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.  In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze.  Credit freeze laws vary from state to state.  The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.  Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.

New Mexico Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze or Submit a Declaration of Removal.  You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You may submit a declaration of removal to remove information placed in your credit report as a result of being a victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.  The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be provided with a personal identification number, password or similar device to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report to a specific party or parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To remove the freeze or to provide authorization for the temporary release of your credit report, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:

(1) the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided by the consumer reporting agency;

(2) proper identification to verify your identity;

(3) information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which the credit report may be released to users of the credit report; and

(4) payment of a fee, if applicable.

A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. As of September 1, 2008, a consumer reporting agency shall comply with the request within fifteen minutes of receiving the request by a secure electronic method or by telephone. A security freeze does not apply in all circumstances, such as where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your credit report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities; for use in setting or adjusting an insurance rate or claim or insurance underwriting; for certain governmental purposes; and for purposes of prescreening as defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.

If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, with enough advance notice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect. You should contact a consumer reporting agency and request it to lift the freeze at least three business days before applying. As of September 1, 2008, if you contact a consumer reporting agency by a secure electronic method or by telephone, the consumer reporting agency should lift the freeze within fifteen minutes. You have a right to bring a civil action against a consumer reporting agency that violates your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.

Additional Information for Massachusetts Residents: Massachusetts law gives you the right to place a security freeze on your consumer reports. The credit reporting company may charge a reasonable fee of up to $5 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft to the credit reporting company.(By law, you have a right to obtain a police report relating to this incident, and if you are the victim of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and obtain a copy of it.) You may request that a freeze be placed on your credit report by sending a request to a credit reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail or regular stamped mail to the address below. The following information should be included when requesting a security freeze (documentation for you and your spouse must be submitted when freezing a spouse’s credit report): full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; Social Security number, date of birth (month, day and year); current address and previous addresses for the past five (5) years; and applicable fee (if any) or incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Department of Motor Vehicles. The request should also include a copy of a government-issued identification card, such as a driver’s license, state or military ID card, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or insurance statement. Each copy should be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue (statement dates must be recent).

The unsecured data was first revealed in a report published on Wednesday by security firm UpGuard, which removed the report from its website later that day. The software vendor, Birst, confirmed to Gizmodo that the data—which did not contain any bank customer information—was left unsecured.

The now-deleted report claimed that Birst’s private encryption keys, as well as administrative credentials and passwords assigned by Birst to Capital One were discovered by UpGuard researchers last month on a publicly accessible cloud server hosted by Amazon. In a statement to Gizmodo, Dan Barnhardt, a spokesperson for Birst’s parent company, Infor, confirmed that a Birst employee uploaded the software to the unsecured Amazon server.

Capital One has contested the UpGuard report’s accuracy, namely that the data exposed by Birst belonged to the bank or that it could potentially pose a risk to its network. “At no time was any Capital One information exposed,” the bank said in a statement Wednesday. “This was simply an instance of a vendor’s software that was hosted in their cloud environment. As a matter of standard practice, Capital One changes all default settings, including credentials, prior to deploying third party software. Because of this, there is no impact to the security of Capital One systems and data.”

The bank’s lawyers were in contact with UpGuard on Wednesday around the time the post went offline, according to UpGuard. “We are taking the post down while we review the content with Capital One,” UpGuard told Gizmodo in an email.

Capital One also requested, on multiple occasions, that Gizmodo delete its story regarding the vanished report.

While UpGuard’s report remains offline, the company has not formally retracted its researchers’ findings, and the status of the report remains unclear. UpGuard declined to comment on whether it has faced lawsuit threats from Capital One. The bank did not answer Gizmodo’s repeated inquiries on the matter.

Although Capital One has repeatedly refused to say whether it uses Birst’s software, Gizmodo has confirmed it was installed on the bank’s hardware by the bank’s staff and remains in use. A Birst spokesperson told Gizmodo by email that once Capital One installed the software, Birst had no access to or control over it.

UpGuard said it found the data on January 15th and that it was secured the same day. Capital One was notified that roughly 50GB worth of data that appeared to belong to the bank had been exposed—the researchers noted that the server’s subdomain was named “capitalone-appliance.” Capital One was left to handle the matter privately with its vendor.

In an email to UpGuard sent after the notification, Gleb Reznik, a Capital One information security officer, thanked UpGuard for its assistance. “We are very appreciative of your work and your mission to safeguard organizations that are venturing in the public cloud environments,” he wrote. “This further reinforces the need for vendors (i.e., Birst) to ensure that their data is protected from unauthorized access.”

Through no fault of its own, Amazon Web Services has been the source of countless data breaches in recent years, and has worked to help companies avoid such disasters. For example, its S3 buckets—the types of cloud servers often at the center of leaks, including Birst’s—are now encrypted by default. Ultimately, the job of keeping data secure falls on the individual or company to whom it belongs.

Since May 2016, Gizmodo has reported on more than a half dozen data breaches based on UpGuard’s research, including one for which Gizmodo received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists last fall. They include similar leaks involving nearly 200 million US voter files, sensitive files linked to the creation of a Pentagon system handling classified materials, the resumes and curriculum vitae of thousands of Americans with classified and up to top secret security clearances, and gigabytes worth of credentials and other documents from one of the country’s largest media conglomerates, among others.

Since Amazon launched a host of new security features in November, data breach hunters have told Gizmodo they’ve seen little to no drop in the number of sensitive leaks. Amazon’s clients are simply failing to utilize the security features available to them—likely because it’s more convenient not to, but also because they don’t realize how painless it is for hackers to locate and collect their exposed data.

A few months ago, the RedLock Cloud Security Intelligence (CSI) team found hundreds of Kubernetes administration consoles accessible over the internet without any password protection. 

A couple of the instances belonged to Aviva, a British multinational insurance company, and Gemalto, the world’s largest manufacturer of SIM cards. Within these consoles, access credentials to these organizations’ Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure environments were exposed. Upon further investigation, the team determined that hackers had secretly infiltrated these organizations’ public cloud environments and were using the compute instances to mine cryptocurrencies (refer to Cloud Security Trends - October 2017 report).

Since then, a number of other cryptojacking incidents have been uncovered and there are notable differences in the attacks. In cases involving the WannaMine malware, a tool called Mimikatz is used to pull credentials from a computer’s memory to infect other computers on the network. The malware then uses the infected computers’ compute to mine a cryptocurrency called Monero quietly in the background. The use of Mimikatz ensures that the malware does not have to rely on the EternalBlue exploit  and enables it to evade detection on fully patched systems.

Nikola Tesla, best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system, aptly suggested: everything evolves over a period of time. Essentially, we are beginning to witness the evolution of crytopjacking as hackers recognize the massive upside of these attacks and begin to explore new variations to evade detection.

“It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know, the more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is only through enlightenment that we become conscious of our limitations. Precisely one of the most gratifying results of intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and greater prospects.”

~ Nikola Tesla 

The Latest Victim: Tesla
New research from the RedLock CSI team revealed that the latest victim of cryptojacking is Tesla. While the attack was similar to the ones at Aviva and Gemalto, there were some notable differences. The hackers had infiltrated Tesla’s Kubernetes console which was not password protected. Within one Kubernetes pod, access credentials were exposed to Tesla’s AWS environment which contained an Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) bucket that had sensitive data such as telemetry.

RedLock | Figure 1: Exposed credentials to Tesla’s AWS environment
Figure 1: Exposed credentials to Tesla’s AWS environment

In addition to the data exposure, hackers were performing crypto mining from within one of Tesla’s Kubernetes pods. The team noted some sophisticated evasion measures that were employed in this attack.

Unlike other crypto mining incidents, the hackers did not use a well known public “mining pool” in this attack. Instead, they installed mining pool software and configured the malicious script to connect to an “unlisted” or semi-public endpoint. This makes it difficult for standard IP/domain based threat intelligence feeds to detect the malicious activity.
The hackers also hid the true IP address of the mining pool server behind CloudFlare, a free content delivery network (CDN) service. The hackers can use a new IP address on-demand by registering for free CDN services. This makes IP address based detection of crypto mining activity even more challenging.
Moreover, the mining software was configured to listen on a non-standard port which makes it hard to detect the malicious activity based on port traffic.
Lastly, the team also observed on Tesla’s Kubernetes dashboard that CPU usage was not very high. The hackers had most likely configured the mining software to keep the usage low to evade detection.
The RedLock CSI team immediately reported the incident to Tesla and the issue was quickly rectified.

Preventing Such Compromises
The skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies is prompting hackers to shift their focus from stealing data to stealing compute power in organizations’ public cloud environments. The nefarious network activity is going completely unnoticed. Here are a few things that can help organizations detect suspicious activities such as crypto mining across fragmented cloud environments:

Monitor Configurations: With DevOps teams delivering applications and services to production without any security oversight, organizations should monitor for risky configurations. This involves deploying tools that can automatically discover resources as soon as they are created, determining the applications running on the resource, and applying appropriate policies based on the resource or application type. Configuration monitoring could have helped Tesla immediately identify that there was an unprotected Kubernetes console exposing their environment.
Monitor Network Traffic: By monitoring network traffic and correlating it with configuration data, Tesla could have detected suspicious network traffic being generated by the compromised Kubernetes pod.

Figure 3: RedLock platform illustrating bitcoin mining traffic detection

Monitor for Suspicious User Behavior: It is not uncommon to find access credentials to public cloud environments exposed on the internet, as was the case in the Uber breach. Organizations need a way to detect account compromises. This requires baselining normal user activities and detecting anomalous behavior that goes beyond just identifying geo-location or time-based anomalies, but also identifying event-based anomalies; see figure 4 below for an example of anomalous user activity detected using the RedLock Cloud 360 platform. In this case, it is possible that Tesla’s AWS access credentials that were leaked from the unprotected Kubernetes pod were subsequently used to perform other nefarious activities.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,66.95400238037111,62.71200180053711,60.01599884033203,55.36399841308594,70.51000213623047,64.04599761962889,61.6879997253418,59.80400085449219,52.0,70.69400024414062,66.59400177001953,60.45199966430664,61.12799835205078,250.0,250.0

In a statement a FedEx spokesperson said the server has since been secured, and the data wasn't ""misappropriated."" The full statement reads:

After a preliminary investigation, we can confirm that some archived Bongo International account information located on a server hosted by a third-party, public cloud provider is secure. The data was part of a service that was discontinued after our acquisition of Bongo.  We have found no indication that any information has been misappropriated and will continue our investigation.

Kromtech was able to get in touch with FedEx through a reporter earlier this week and secure the compromised data. This likely means anyone whose information was housed in that server is safe.

Alex Heid, white hat hacker and chief research officer at SecurityScorecard, said in a call it's very likely none of the data was used, but it was sitting there for a long time. ""Thankfully this group was working to report that type of stuff,"" unlike the Equifax breach last year where the information was used maliciously.

He said this type of information leak is ""incredibly common"" as ""new big data technologies become easier to use,"" but companies don't necessarily know how to use and secure them, like this Amazon S3 server forgotten in an years-old acquisition.

Bell Canada spokesman Nathan Gibson told The Canadian Press that “fewer than 100,000 customers were affected.”

RCMP spokeswoman Stephanie Dumoulin, at the police force’s national division in Ottawa, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner said they couldn’t disclose details.

“We are following up with Bell to obtain information regarding what took place and what they are doing to mitigate the situation, and to determine follow up actions,” said the federal privacy watchdog’s spokeswoman Tobi Cohen.

Bell Canada has alerted customers who were affected, and also informed them that additional security, authentication and identification requirements have been implemented.


“When discussing your account with our service representatives, you will be asked for this additional information to verify your identity,” its emailed notice to customers said.

Katy Anderson, a Calgary-based digital rights advocate with OpenMedia, said she’s glad Bell is implementing additional security checks.

“However, this is the second time the company has been hit by hackers in eight months,” Anderson said in a phone interview.

Bell Canada revealed in May that an anonymous hacker had obtained access to about 1.9 million active email addresses and about 1,700 customer names and active phone numbers.

Anderson said that the public should realize that centralized data is vulnerable, by its nature.

“When a breach like this happens, which we’re seeing more and more, it’s always a good reminder to change your passwords, update your security questions with things only you would know, and consider using a password manager,” Anderson said.

Bell’s latest data breach follows several other high-profile hacks, including at credit monitoring company Equifax and car-hailing service Uber, though those companies did not immediately disclose the breaches.

The federal government is in the process of reviewing changes to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act that would require companies to notify people in the event of a serious data breach.

But until those come into force, Alberta is the only province in Canada that has mandatory reporting requirements for private-sector companies.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,46.63999938964844,43.97000122070313,42.709999084472656,41.7599983215332,42.41999816894531,40.959999084472656,41.97999954223633,41.400001525878906,40.59000015258789,40.5,42.11000061035156,39.959999084472656,41.72000122070313,60.0,59.37945454545454

January 19, 2018 by Rajiv Leventhal  | Reprints
 
Health IT vendor Allscripts has acknowledged that it is investigating a ransomware incident that has impacted a limited number of its applications.

As first reported yesterday by HIStalk via a message from an end-user of Allscripts, the ransomware attack took down some of the applications that are hosted at the company’s data centers in North Carolina—specifically in Raleigh and in Charlotte. In particular, the Allscripts Professional EHR platform and some of its e-prescribing systems became unavailable to customers in these areas.

In a statement emailed to Healthcare Informatics today, an Allscripts spokesperson noted, “We are investigating a ransomware incident that has impacted a limited number of our applications. We are working diligently to restore these systems, and most importantly, to ensure our clients’ data is protected.  Although our investigation is ongoing, there is currently no evidence that any data has been removed from our systems.  We regret any inconvenience caused by this temporary outage.”

Nonetheless, some Allscripts end-users haven taken to Twitter over the last 24 hours to express their dissatisfaction:

 #ransomware attack on Allscripts has taken down our e-prescribing, EPCS and some other services! Yikes!! At least we don’t use their hosted application I hear many hosted practices couldn’t access their EMR yesterday. Talk about a shutdown!

filed on January 8, 2018 (Ruderman). The plaintiffs in these cases, who purport to represent various classes of individuals whose information was contained within the dataset, claim to have been harmed or to be facing harm as a result of the exposure of their personal information. The complaints assert claims for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq. and state consumer-protection statutes, as well as claims for common-law negligence.

U-Haul Co. of California (“U-Haul”), where some of your data may have potentially been obtained by an
unauthorized individual. We are contacting you to provide information about steps we have taken to
protect your personal information, some additional steps you should consider, and where to go to get
additional help or information. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience this incident causes you.
What Happened
U-Haul Company was notified of a possible incident involving certain U-Haul customers who reserved
and/or rented equipment from Solo Tire, an independent U-Haul dealer in Orange, California. U-Haul
immediately launched an internal investigation and hired a forensic security firm to assist in the
investigation. Findings from our investigation suggest that one computer workstation at this dealership
had been infected with malware designed to target payment card information, but which may have also
accessed other rental information.
What Information Was Involved
For customers who reserved and/or rented from Solo Tire from January 10, 2017 through October 16,
2017, information associated with that equipment rental may have been obtained by an unauthorized third
party. This information may have included your name, address, phone number, email address, driver’s
license number, birth date, and payment card number and expiration date. We are notifying you because
you made or attempted to make an equipment reservation/rental from this location during this period
using a payment card(s) ending in <<Cards Last 4>>. Our investigation has determined that this incident
was contained to the Solo Tire location and has not affected the corporate U-Haul network and customer
data in our system.
What We Are Doing
Upon notification of the incident, we immediately implemented procedures to eliminate the threat. We
have worked closely with Solo Tire to improve the security of their system and to monitor for subsequent
attacks. We continue to coordinate with both our independent dealers and our own employees in order to
re-emphasize the importance of protecting customers’ information.
Out of an abundance of caution, we are also offering a complimentary one-year membership of
Experian’s® IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal
information and provides you with support focused on the identification and resolution of identity theft.
What You Can Do
In light of this development, we recommend that you monitor your account statements for any
unauthorized activity and report any suspected fraud immediately. Card network rules generally provide
that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are reported promptly.
We also encourage you to take advantage of the identity theft protection services being offered. Please see

While the idea that your real name is exposed in a product review you left for a benign product like clothing or books is disturbing enough, Google is also displaying eBay customer names for sensitive purchases such as medical diagnostic tests - including pregnancy, drug, and HIV home testing kits.

A reader who provided EcommerceBytes with the news tip told us, ""As both an eBay seller as well as being a buyer who has left product reviews for item that I have purchased on eBay, this new revelation is very disturbing to me. Furthermore what really scared me is the fact that with very little effort on my part I was able to match the reviewers actual name with their anonymous eBay user ID, by opening both the eBay product page and the Google Shopping product page in separate windows and placing them side by side.""

For every search we conducted, from cookbooks to medical test kits, all of the reviews on Google Shopping Product Pages that were provided by eBay.com displayed actual customer names and the date they left the review, while reviews from other online retailers, such as Target.com and Walmart.com displayed user IDs.

It's not likely that someone who purchased a medical diagnostic test on eBay name would be thrilled that their review might be read by family members, partners or employers. One buyer was clearly concerned about the privacy of his purchase, noting in his review of a test kit he'd purchased on eBay that he was pleased it had come in discrete packaging.

EcommerceBytes was also able to do some matching of real names and user names of product reviews on Google Shopping and on eBay; once we had the eBay user name, we could see what other reviews they left. If they also used their eBay account to sell items, we could see their location (usually city, state, and country).

It appears there is a flaw in the feed eBay provides to Google, and this not the first time that eBay has been accused of compromising users' privacy. In 2014, NYU researchers discovered that they could aggregate eBay buyers' purchases, and characterized it as a security breach - and that was when they had only the user names, not the actual names of buyers.

As part of the 2014 study, the researchers conducted a survey to gauge buyer expectations around privacy on the marketplace, they found nearly 39% preferred to make a sensitive or private purchase on eBay, ""noting that they believed the site was a more discrete vendor than a physical store.""

""Additionally, 38 percent of those surveyed believed that their purchase histories were visible to no one except them,"" the NYU researchers wrote. 

We can't overstate how troubling this breach of privacy is, and of all the developments that have caused users to be concerned about privacy over the years, this tops the list right next to eBay's massive data breach of 2014 when it forced 145 million users to change their passwords. 

We reached out to eBay and Google prior to publishing, a Google spokesperson said he would look into the matter. eBay as not yet responded.

Last month, the payments firm suspended operations, pending a security review, of its TIO Networks unit. That company makes digital bill-payment tools for utilities and other firms and also operates a network of kiosks in physical retail stores.

PayPal said Friday that an investigation into security vulnerabilities at TIO had found users' information was potentially compromised.

Among customer information possibly affected, according to a PayPal spokesman, were names, addresses, bank-account details, Social Security numbers and login details of consumers who used TIO to pay bills.

How much of a given user's data was potentially compromised depends on whether he or she used TIO's smartphone apps, web tools or kiosks, the spokesman said. He added that no one TIO service had the full range of customer data exposed and that PayPal hasn't found any evidence the information was taken out of TIO.

Following PayPal's announcement, the New York Department of Financial Services said in a statement that is working with the company, which it regulates, to ""investigate and address issues related to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.""

Revelations of potential data-security issues at TIO comes nearly three months after credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. said that hackers had taken vital personal information belonging to potentially 145.5 million Americans.

PayPal paid roughly $238 million in cash to acquire TIO in a deal that closed in July. When the transaction was announced in February, PayPal Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready told The Wall Street Journal that TIO would help the company reach more consumers who lack traditional financial accounts.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391718000029/0001633917-18-000029-index.htm,Risk Factors | MDA | Footnotes,2018-02-07 00:00:00,"In November 2017, we announced that we had suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) as part of an ongoing investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. On December 1, 2017 we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO’s network, including locations that stored personal information of some of TIO’s customers and customers of TIO billers and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million customers. We have received a number of governmental inquiries, including from state attorneys general, and we may be subject to additional governmental inquiries and investigations in the future. In addition, on December 6, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit captioned Sgarlata v.

Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that Defendants made false or misleading statements or failed to disclose that TIO’s data security program was inadequate to safeguard the personally identifiable information of its users, those vulnerabilities threatened continued operation of TIO’s platform, the Company’s revenues derived from TIO services were thus unsustainable, and consequently, the Company overstated the benefits of the TIO acquisition, and, as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

While Dow Jones has confirmed that at least 2.2 million customers were affected, UpGuard calculations put the number closer to 4 million accounts.

The exposed data includes the names, addresses, account information, email addresses, and last four digits of credit card numbers of millions of subscribers to Dow Jones publications like The Wall Street Journal and Barron's. Also exposed in the cloud leak were the details of 1.6 million entries in a suite of databases known as Dow Jones Risk and Compliance, a set of subscription-only corporate intelligence programs used largely by financial institutions for compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.

The UpGuard Cyber Risk Team is a unit devoted to discovering data exposures where they exist, aiding in securing sensitive information against possible exploitation, and raising public awareness about the issues of cyber risk driving data insecurity across the digital landscape.

The exposed data repository, an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, had been configured via permission settings to allow any AWS “Authenticated Users” to download the data via the repository’s URL. Per Amazon’s own definition, an “authenticated user” is “any user that has an Amazon AWS account,” a base that already numbers over a million users; registration for such an account is free.

The revelation of this cloud leak speaks to the sustained danger of process error as a cause of data insecurity, with improper security settings allowing the leakage of the sensitive information of millions of Dow Jones customers. The data exposed in this cloud leak could be exploited by malicious actors employing a number of attack vectors already known to have been successful in the past. Finally, the aversion of Dow Jones and Company to notifying affected customers of this data exposure denies consumers the ability to swiftly act to protect their own personal information.

The Discovery
On the evening of May 30th, 2017, UpGuard Director of Cyber Risk Research Chris Vickery discovered an Amazon S3 cloud-based data repository accessible to AWS authenticated users under the subdomain “dj-skynet.” While the title and contents of the repository indicate the data to have originated from within Dow Jones—as later confirmed by Dow Jones & Company’s Chief Information Security Officer —”Skynet” appears to be a reference to the doomsday computer system in “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.”

On June 1st, Vickery began downloading the contents of the repository, which was secured on June 6th. Contained within the “dj-skynet” repository were several dozen directories, among them, folders containing the phrases “build_assets,” “development,” “customerlogin,” and “cust_subscription.” Clicking into the folder containing this last phrase presented four compressed Apache Avro files totaling 771 MB in size; the smallest of these files, at 89 MB, clocks in at 2 GB when decompressed.


The contents of the “table=ics_cust_subscription” folder.

Once decompressed, these files are revealed to be four large text logs composed entirely of Dow Jones customer data, prepared in a format that could easily be fed into a database for internal record-keeping. Among the fields populated with data throughout the text files are customer names, internal Dow Jones customer IDs, home and business addresses, and account details, such as the promotional offer under which a customer signed up for a subscription. Perhaps most critical was the inclusion of the last four digits of customer credit cards in the files, as well as customer email addresses also used to login to their accounts online. A small percentage of customers also had their phone numbers exposed in the files.

Dow Jones & Company has confirmed that 2.2 million customers were exposed in this manner. However, per analysis of the size and composition of the repository, UpGuard conservatively estimates that the number may be as high as four million, though duplicated subscriptions may account for some of the difference.

Also stored in the main repository is a folder titled “rnc_watchlist.” While the Dow Jones Risk and Compliance Watchlist was also the name of a previously offered product, this folder title may reference data of more recent and ongoing relevance to Dow Jones’s suite of anti-corruption databases. These products, sold under Dow Jones’s Risk and Compliance brand, are advertised as “[helping] companies evaluate third party risks faster and with more confidence” by providing users with “research tools and outsourced services for on-boarding, vetting and investigation to help companies comply with anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, corruption and economic sanctions regulation in mitigating third party risk.”

Within this folder are 21 schema files, explaining various field names for the data set, as well as a .csv title also named djrc_ac_csv_201603312359_f. This .csv file lists 1.6 million rows of people or entities, along with any associated aliases, organizations, and businesses, as well as the subject’s background and personal history.


Several of the fields in the apparent Risk and Compliance data set.

The list includes a great many financial industry personnel located around the world, as well as many more well-known parties of ill-repute; reproduced below is the entry for deceased Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.


Muammar Gaddafi’s apparent entry in the Risk and Compliance .csv file.

This set of 1.6 million suspicious persons or entities bears a great similarity to Dow Jones’s public descriptions of the contents of Risk and Compliance research tools like RiskReports and RiskCenter, platforms that provide subscribers with information on potentially questionable characters and organizations best avoided in the financial world.

The Significance
This cloud leak raises several critical issues of cyber risk bearing wider significance across the digital landscape of 2017. The configuration of cloud-based storage by enterprises to allow public or semi-public access is by now an all-too-common story, a move that needlessly exposes sensitive customer data to the risk of exploitation. The threat of such misuse is all too real, and indeed, has grown endemic, with a burgeoning cyber underworld in which malicious actors are able to swiftly take advantage of such user lapses for their own benefit.

While UpGuard has no knowledge positively or negatively as to whether any such malicious actors may have accessed the exposed Dow Jones repository prior to its closure, the incident is instructive in showing how cyber criminals could have done so. Customer names, addresses, email addresses, and the smaller amount of phone numbers would be of use to any spammers or digital marketers, but could also be used to far more malign effect.

The spectre of phishing, in which malicious actors pose as an authority acting in some official capacity to convince users to supply their sensitive personal details, is by now a well-known tactic. With a list of four million subscribers to Dow Jones publications, it is not hard to see how malicious actors could deploy phishing messages against exposed customers. Sending official-looking emails purporting to be from The Wall Street Journal notifying customers their subscription had lapsed, or that their accounts had been compromised, malicious actors could have succeeded in convincing such high-value targets to supply credit card information, login credentials, or more.

While it is a relief that only the last four digits of customer credit cards were exposed in the breach, even this data could potentially be used to damaging effect. A vulnerability discovered in 2015 allowed anyone in possession of the last 4 digits of a Chase or Bank of America CC number to, in combination with the victim’s phone number, gain control of the account.

Finally, of great concern is the response of Dow Jones & Company’s leadership. While few enterprises would enjoy notifying customers of such an event, it is of the utmost importance to enable consumers to secure their data and impede the ability of any malicious actors to take advantage of the exposure. To not do so is counterproductive, as seen in the recent case of UK-based insurer The AA, which in April 2017 denied the existence of a publicly accessible server, only to see this proven false in July with the revelation that over 100,000 customers had had their financial details exposed.

As illustrated in this cloud leak, and by Dow Jones’s sluggish response, the risky handling of customer data is not a behavior exclusive merely to low-rent firms, but can occur in the operations of esteemed, well-known organizations occupying the upper echelons of the financial world. In short, the problem of cyber risk is pervasive; its consequences are felt everywhere from the boiler room to the boardroom. Enterprises must start regaining control over their IT systems to ensure easily preventable mistakes are caught quickly, or face a costly digital backlash.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,15.949999809265135,16.649999618530273,17.5,16.700000762939453,15.949999809265135,16.25,16.049999237060547,15.75,15.100000381469727,13.800000190734865,13.350000381469727,12.84000015258789,13.270000457763672,16.185,16.185

Officials are probing allegations that data from more than a million students who are clients of Beijing-based Qudian was leaked and possibly sold online, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information. The investigation is ongoing and may not lead to any action against Qudian, the people said.

The probe’s initial findings show that at least part of the leaked data match information clients had provided to Qudian, the people said. Investigators are checking whether the data came from Qudian, if the company was aware of the breach, and whether it took necessary measures to ensure the safety of personal information it collects.





Qudian said it isn’t aware of the situation in an e-mailed reply to questions. The company added that it has always highly valued safeguarding customers’ personal information, and that it continues to improve its encryption and data security.

Two calls to the Ministry of Public Security went unanswered.

Qudian’s shares have slumped 33 percent since its initial public offering in New York in October, as China’s government moved to crack down on the mushrooming industry of online cash microlending. Such lenders typically offer quick, short-term unsecured loans that are used for consumption.

We are writing to inform you that Boise Cascade Company (""Boise Cascade"" or ""the
Company""), headquartered in Boise, Idaho, recently discovered a criminal intrusion into its
information systems. This intrusion involved an attempt to change employees' direct
deposit instructions.
The Company's investigation determined that a phishing scheme got into its email system
on or about October 31, 2017. Our information technology team caught the scheme within
minutes of the first phishing email, blocked the email, and notified employees not to click on
the link in it or similar emails. Unfortunately, approximately 300 employees clicked on the
link anyway. The investigation further revealed that company-wide, 23 employees' direct
deposit instructions were changed. There was one employee affected in New
Hampshire. Through its normal direct deposit processes, the Company issued paper
checks to most of those employees because there was not enough time to effect the
change. It is when one of those employees contacted the payroll department on November
9 to inquire about receiving a paper check that the Company discovered the breach of its
system.
On November 9, the Company's payroll department deactivated 28 employee direct
deposits that had been changed within a week. Twenty-three of those accounts were
determined to have been changed because of the phishing scheme. All of the 23 impacted
employees were notified of the issue with their accounts via telephone call and email on
November 9. Written notifications confirming the telephone conversations and email
notices were sent to the employees on November 15.

As an employee
of ABM Industries Incorporated or one of its subsidiaries (“ABM”), you provided ABM with certain personal information,
and the security of your information is important to us. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your
personal information, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with information about a recent incident,
steps we are taking in response, and steps you can take to protect against fraud, should you feel it is appropriate.
What Happened? On or about August 1, 2017, we discovered that ABM had become the target of a phishing email
campaign. For background, phishing is a type of electronic attack where outside individuals impersonate a trusted
person or company to obtain information or install dangerous software. Several ABM employees had clicked on
the phishing emails and entered their credentials. As is our protocol, we immediately took steps to secure these
employees’ email accounts and launched an in-depth investigation to determine whether any sensitive information
was accessed or acquired.
We subsequently determined, with the help of outside computer forensic investigators, that an unknown actor had
gained access to certain ABM email accounts. ABM determined, after a programmatic and manual review of the
contents of the affected email accounts, the types of protected information contained in the affected email accounts
and to which individuals the information relates.
What Information Was Involved? While we currently have no evidence that the unauthorized individual or individuals
actually accessed or acquired your information, we have confirmed that your name<<ClientDef1(data elements

What We Are Doing. We take the security of information in our care very seriously. Since discovering this event, we
have been working diligently with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information
was accessible to the unknown actor. This has involved a programmatic and manual data review process. It is important
to us to let you know this happened and are providing notice of this event to you, and to certain regulators and consumer
reporting agencies.

What Happened? On September 21, 2017, our system monitoring tools identified unusual activity relating
to a database within our network that is tied to a web application used by customers. We disabled the web
application and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity.
A leading third-party forensic investigation firm was retained to assist with our own internal investigation.

amount of data left our system between June 18, 2017 and September 19, 2017. As we cannot determine
the contents of this data, we cannot rule out that this data included personal information relating to [Data

investigation team to ensure the security of our systems. We are reporting this incident to law enforcement,

The pizza seller has called in the Australian information commissioner to investigate the breach but insists its systems haven’t been compromised. Instead, it blames a “former supplier’s systems” for leaking customer email addresses, names and store suburb.

“Domino’s acted quickly to contain the information when it became aware of the issue and has commenced a detailed review process,” an undated statement posted on the company’s website reads.

The company did not say when it first became aware of the issue and insists no financial information has been accessed.

Customers complained on social media about the “eerie” personalised emails and the lack of communication from Domino’s Australia.

“It was a bit eery [sic] getting all these spam emails that somehow knew my name and suburb and initially were making it past the spam filter,” Mitchell Dale posted on Domino’s Facebook page.

“The decision to try to keep me in the dark and not announce what had happened is why I will not be ordering Dominos again.”

“Nothing better than waking up finding out your data has been breached,” Dylan James posted on Facebook. “Why haven’t you informed anyone yet?”

“I won’t be ordering from you again, not because of the breach but because of how you chose to handle it,” Lara Douglas posted.

Mandatory data breach notification laws will come into effect in February 2018, meaning organisations like Domino’s will have to notify customers of any data breaches.

The assistant minister for cybersecurity, Dan Tehan, advised people to watch for suspicious messages, links and attachments. “You should always be suspicious of unsolicited emails requesting personal or financial information,” he said.

Domino’s Australia says it ceased working with the former supplier in July.

Pizza Hut told customers by email on Saturday that some of their personal information may have been compromised. Some of those customers are angry that it took almost two weeks for the fast food chain to notify them.

According to a customer notice emailed from the pizza chain, those who placed an order on its website or mobile app between the morning of Oct. 1 and midday Oct. 2 might have had their information exposed.

The “temporary security intrusion” lasted for about 28 hours, the notice said, and it’s believed that names, billing ZIP codes, delivery addresses, email addresses and payment card information — meaning account number, expiration date and CVV number — were compromised.

“The security intrusion at issue impacted a small percentage of our customers and we estimate that less than one percent of the visits to our website over the course of the relevant week were affected,” read a customer notice sent only to those affected. “That said, we regret to say that we believe your information is among that impacted group.”

A call center operator told McClatchy that about 60,000 people across the U.S. were affected.

The customer notice said Pizza Hut is talking to cybersecurity experts outside of the company to look into the apparent hack and to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Affected customers are advised to look out for scams asking for personal information because of the hack, as Pizza Hut will not ask you for personal information like your social security number, the company said.

The company is also offering a free credit monitoring service for a year with Kroll Information Assurance, LLC. You have until Jan. 11 to register for the credit monitoring service, the notice said.

Doug Terfehr, Pizza Hut's director of communications, told McClatchy in a statement that Pizza Hut worked as quickly as it could to notify customers.

“We take the privacy and security of our customers very seriously and invest in resources to protect the customer information in our care. We value the trust our customers place in us and while we were able to address this incident quickly, we regret that this happened and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused,” Terfehr said.

There are multiple reasons why customers aren’t notified of a hack immediately. For example, law enforcement can delay an announcement to prevent other hackers from being notified about a security breach, The Washington Post reported.

It also takes time for companies to determine the exact scope of a hack, what information was stolen in the first place and if the data taken could cause serious damage to customers, according to the Post.

There are different standards in 48 states and U.S. territories for how and when a hack needs to be disclosed. Alabama and South Dakota are the only states that don’t have security breach notification laws, the Post reported.

And of those 48 states, only eight states -- Connecticut, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Vermont -- set a timeline for when the hacks need to be announced, which range from 30 to 90 days, according to the Post.

In 2012, Pizza Hut Australia had its website hacked, with the personal information of 240,000 customers compromised, according to ZDNet.

It was reported that the credit card information of those users in the 2012 attack were compromised, but Pizza Hut Australia denied those reports, saying it was just emails and other contact information.

Dear Hyatt Guest,

We understand the importance of protecting customer information and securing our systems, and we regret to inform you that we discovered signs of and then resolved unauthorized access to payment card information from cards manually entered or swiped at the front desk of certain Hyatt-managed locations between March 18, 2017 and July 2, 2017. A list of affected hotels and respective at-risk dates is available here.

Upon discovery, we launched a comprehensive investigation to understand what happened and how this occurred, including engaging leading third-party experts, payment card networks and authorities. Based on our investigation, we understand that such unauthorized access to card data was caused by an insertion of malicious software code from a third party onto certain hotel IT systems. Our enhanced cybersecurity measures and additional layers of defense implemented over time helped to identify and resolve the issue. I want to assure you that there is no indication that information beyond that gained from payment cards – cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code – was involved, and as a result of implemented measures designed to prevent this from happening in the future, guests can feel confident using payment cards at Hyatt hotels worldwide.

While we estimate that the incident affected a small percentage of payment cards used by guests who visited the group of affected Hyatt hotels during the at-risk time period, the available information and data does not allow Hyatt to identify each specific payment card that may have been affected. It’s important to Hyatt that we notify guests and provide helpful information about steps they can take, and we have directly contacted all guests for whom we have appropriate contact information that checked in to an affected hotel during the at-risk dates. As always, the primary step customers can take is to review their payment card account statements closely and report any unauthorized charges to their card issuer immediately.

This incident is something we take seriously, and we are sorry for the inconvenience and concern this may cause our guests. If you have questions or would like more information, please call:

The buckets' contents appear to be the software for the corporation’s enterprise cloud offering, Accenture Cloud Platform, a “multi-cloud management platform” used by Accenture’s customers, which “include 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500” - raising the possibility that, if valid, exposed Accenture data could have been used for critical secondary attacks against these clients. With a CSTAR cyber risk score of 790 out of a possible 950, this cloud leak shows that even the most advanced and secure enterprises can expose crucial data and risk serious consequences.

The Discovery
On September 17th, 2017, UpGuard Director of Cyber Risk Research Chris Vickery discovered four Amazon Web Services S3 storage buckets configured for public access, downloadable to anyone who entered the buckets’ web addresses into their internet browser. A cursory analysis on September 18th of the four buckets - titled with the AWS subdomains “acp-deployment,” “acpcollector,” “acp-software,” and “acp-ssl” - revealed significant internal Accenture data, including cloud platform credentials and configurations, prompted Vickery to notify the corporation; the four AWS buckets were secured the next day.

All four S3 buckets contain highly sensitive data about Accenture Cloud Platform, its inner workings, and Accenture clients using the platform. All were maintained by an account named “awsacp0175,” a possible indication of the buckets’ origin.



The bucket “acp-deployment” appears to be largely devoted to storing internal access keys and credentials for use by the Identity API, which is apparently used to authenticate credentials. A folder in the bucket titled “Secure Store” contains not only configuration files for the Identity API, but also a plaintext document containing the master access key for Accenture’s account with Amazon Web Service’s Key Management Service, exposing an unknown number of credentials to malicious use.

Also contained in the bucket is a number of “client.jks” files - stored in some cases alongside what is believed to be the plaintext password necessary to decrypt the file. It is unknown precisely what the keys in “clients.jks” could be used to access. Private signing keys were also exposed within these files - placing a critical tool in the hands of anyone who encountered them.

The bucket “acpcollector” appears to contain data necessary for visibility into and maintenance of Accenture’s cloud stores. The bucket contains VPN keys used in production for Accenture’s private network, potentially exposing a master view of Accenture’s cloud ecosystem. Also contained in the bucket are logs listing events occurring in each cloud instance, enabling malicious actors to gain far-reaching insight into Accenture’s operations.



At a size of 137 GB, the bucket “acp-software” is much larger, giving some indication of its contents: large database dumps that include credentials, some of which appear to be for some Accenture clients. While many of the passwords contained here are hashed - passwords mathematically transformed into an alphanumeric string - a collection of nearly 40,000 plaintext passwords is present in one of the database backups. Access keys for Enstratus, a cloud infrastructure management platform, are also exposed here, potentially leaking the data of other tools coordinated by Enstratus. Information about Accenture’s ASGARD database, as well as internal Accenture email info, are also contained here.

Also in this bucket are data dumps from the Zenoss event tracker used by Accenture, revealing such incidents as the adding of new users, recording of IP addresses, and JSession IDs which, if not expired, could be plugged into cookies to gain entry past authentication portals. An examination reveals a number of Accenture clients recorded in this manner.



Finally, credentials for what appear to be Accenture’s Google and Azure accounts are also present in this folder - another critical revelation which could be used to gain further access to and control of Accenture assets.

The final bucket “acp-ssl,” contains more key stores in a folder called “acp.aws.accenture.com.” The keys appear to provide access to various Accenture environments, such as one titled “Cloud File Store Key,” among a number of private keys, as well as certificates that, in theory, could be used to decrypt traffic between Accenture and clients, potentially gathering any sensitive information as it is sent across the wire.

The Significance
Taken together, the significance of these exposed buckets is hard to overstate. In the hands of competent threat actors, these buckets, accessible to anyone stumbling across their URLs, could have exposed both Accenture and its thousands of top-flight corporate customers to malicious attacks that could have done an untold amount of financial damage.

It is possible a malicious actor could have used the exposed keys to impersonate Accenture, dwelling silently within the company’s IT environment to gather more information. The specter of password reuse attacks also looms large, across multiple platforms, websites, and potentially hundreds of clients.



Enterprises must be able to secure their data against exposures of this type, which could have been prevented with a simple password requirement added to each bucket. Accenture’s relatively middle-of-the-road CSTAR score of 790 is a testament to the difficulty modern IT departments must face: how can we ensure all of our systems are configured as they need to be, even at scale? Until such enterprises can trust that their systems are only accessible as needed, hugely damaging exposures of this type will persist, exposing us all to the brunt of cyber risk.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,136.91000366210938,143.88999938964844,150.69000244140625,159.11000061035156,154.9499969482422,161.69000244140625,148.39999389648438,157.0800018310547,162.75,166.30999755859375,160.67999267578125,170.69000244140625,156.0,165.0,165.0

The company contacted the targeted customers over the last two weeks, after Motherboard revealed that a bug on a T-Mobile website allowed hackers to access customers' personal data such as email address, account number, and their phone's IMSI, a standardized unique number that identifies subscribers.

Before T-Mobile patched the bug on October 10, hackers had been taking advantage of it to pull customers' personal data and then use it to impersonate them. No password, social security, or financial information was exposed in these attacks, according to a T-Mobile spokesperson.

The ultimate goal was to hijack or ""swap"" the victim's SIM cards. This gives the criminals a chance to take over their phone number and then move onto targeting other online accounts that might have been linked to the number, such as email and banking accounts, according to a blackhat hacker who is familiar with these attempts and requested to remain anonymous. (To prove he knew about these attempts, the hacker sent me my own account's data.)

This is a relatively rare, but extremely dangerous kind of scam that can even be used to steal SMS-based two-factor authentication codes, giving cybercriminals the ability to hack into your account if they can also steal your password.

On Monday, a T-Mobile customer support representative called to inform me ""of a detected alert"" about my personal information. On Wednesday, a company spokesperson confirmed via email that T-Mobile has contacted ""a few hundred customers"" who were impacted.

""If you were impacted you were called,"" the spokesperson told me on the phone.

""We found that there were a few hundred customers targeted,"" the spokesperson later said in a statement. ""We take our customers' privacy very seriously and called all of those customers to inform them that some of their personal data appeared to have been accessed by an unknown third party. We also offered to work with them to ensure their account remains secure.""

The spokesperson did not specify exactly how many customers were targeted.

The bug was reported in early October by Karan Saini, a security researcher. As it turns out, however, hackers had known about the vulnerability since at least August 6, when a hacker uploaded a tutorial on YouTube on how to exploit the vulnerability.

Initially, when Motherboard and the researcher reached out, T-Mobile said that there was ""no indication that [the bug] was shared more broadly."" On October 11, a T-Mobile spokesperson said that ""as of this time we've found no evidence of customer accounts affected as a result of this vulnerability.""

Clearly, that was not the case, and security experts criticized T-Mobile for not detecting these attacks earlier.


The T-Mobile customer support I spoke with said that someone was trying to duplicate my SIM card and that's why they were calling. The representative suggested changing the online account password, and set-up a ""SIM lock."" This forces more stringent controls when someone tries to get a new SIM card for a customer's phone number.

If you were targeted by hackers taking advantage of this bug, T-Mobile should've called you. But if you're worried someone might target you in the future in a similar way, the company recommends setting up a phone password or passhprase that is only requested when you call T-Mobile support on the phone and is separate and different from the one you use for your online account. This, just like the SIM lock, adds another layer of security and makes it harder for hackers to hijack your phone number.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,61.56000137329102,56.0,62.540000915527344,65.59999847412111,59.20000076293945,65.25,59.7400016784668,56.31999969482422,57.79999923706055,61.34000015258789,64.97000122070311,65.55999755859375,68.45999908447266,71.0,70.0

NATURE OF THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE 
Briggs experienced a malware attack on Briggs' computer systems at its Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Munnsville, New York locations that potentially compromised information from approximately July 25, 2017 to July 28, 2017. Briggs became aware of this incident on July 25, 2017 and took immediate steps to both contain and thoroughly investigate the attack. Although Briggs has no evidence of actual misuse of any of information, it notified individuals out of an abundance of caution because the malware, by its nature, could have allowed a third party to access, use, and/or disclose individuals' account-related, human resources, and/or health plan information as listed on the sample copy of the notice enclosed. 
After discovery of this incident, Briggs notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Due to the ongoing investigation, law enforcement requested that Briggs delay notifying individuals of the incident until September 30, 2017. Briggs complied with that request and mailed notifications to potentially affected individuals on September 29, 2017. Enclosed is a sample copy of the notice that is being provided to the individuals potentially affected. 
STEPS WE ARE TAKING RELATED TO THE INCIDENT 
In response to this incident, Briggs hired forensic consultants to eradicate the malware, determine if any information was compromised, and help Briggs prevent an incident like this from happening in the future. Briggs also provided potentially affected individuals with three (3) bureau credit monitoring and identity theft protection through Experian IdentityWorks at no cost to the individual for one ( 1) year.

9. Do you have an estimate of the costs you expect to incur related the cybersecurity incident, including
timing? Does Equifax have cyber insurance and to what extent will it offset the financial impact of this
incident?
At this time, it is too early for us to provide specific estimates of the costs we expect to incur related to the
cybersecurity incident. The most significant near-term costs expected to be incurred will be delivering our
TrustedID Premier identity theft protection and credit file monitoring product for a period of 12 months to
consumers who enroll. In addition, Equifax will incur legal, forensic consulting and other costs related to the
incident. Equifax carries cybersecurity, crime, general liability and other lines of insurance, and we have
begun discussions with our carriers regarding the incident.
10. How will you disclose the costs related to the cybersecurity incident in your financial statements and public
filings?
Equifax will separately disclose costs specifically related to this cybersecurity incident, as well as any insurance
reimbursements that offset these costs. These costs and reimbursements will be treated as non-GAAP items
in our presentation of Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA margin. The timing of the accrual for or incurrence
of related costs may differ from the timing of recognizing insurance reimbursement for those costs.
11. Do you expect this cybersecurity incident to impact your long term financial model?
Equifax remains committed to delivering on the long term financial model of 7-10% revenue growth and 11%-
14% growth in Adjusted EPS on average over a business cycle. Equifax’s long term financial model reflects our
continuing fundamental ability to utilize our unique and differentiated data assets and leading analytical
capability to deliver high value products and services to our customers.
12. Are you expecting any near term impact to your financial results from the cybersecurity incident?
We do expect some disruption to our business, as we focus on completing the detailed investigation of this
event, taking the steps needed to minimize the likelihood that this type of incident will happen again, and
working with customers to address their concerns and maintain their trust as a leading supplier of consumer
data and analytics. We also expect impacts to our Global Consumer business as it focuses on delivering
TrustedID Premier to US consumers. We will provide a further update on our 3Q17 earnings call in October.
13. Does this cybersecurity incident impact your capital allocation priorities going forward?
Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged at this time. As we have previously indicated, our investment
priorities in order of importance are: (1) internal investment; (2) dividends; (3) acquisition; and (4) share
repurchase. We do, however, expect to increase our capital spending in an effort to further accelerate IT
infrastructure, systems and data security and resiliency improvement actions.
14. When was the Board made aware of the incident? What has their involvement been?
We promptly informed the Board upon learning the potential scope of the incident and have engaged them
since then in regular discussions.
15. Are you still planning to attend sell-side conferences scheduled for the remainder of the year?
Yes, investors are an important constituency and we intend to continue a high level of accessibility and
participation in conferences, NDR’s and other meeting requests.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/33185/000003318517000026/0000033185-17-000026-index.htm,2017-09-07 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/33185/000003318517000032/0000033185-17-000032-index.htm,Risk Factors | MDA | Footnotes | Controls,2017-11-09 00:00:00,"Cybersecurity Incident. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers. Criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files. Based on our forensic investigation, the unauthorized access occurred from mid-May through July 2017. The information accessed primarily includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. In addition, credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. and Canadian consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers, were accessed. The investigation also determined that personal information of approximately 8,000 Canadian consumers was impacted and

17



approximately 690,000 potentially affected U.K. consumers will be contacted regarding access to personal information in the cybersecurity incident.

Upon discovery of the unauthorized access, we acted immediately to stop the intrusion and promptly engaged a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a comprehensive forensic review to determine the scope of the intrusion, including the specific data impacted. The forensic analysis of the consumers potentially impacted by the cybersecurity incident is now complete. We also reported the criminal access to law enforcement and continue to cooperate with law enforcement in connection with the criminal investigation into the actors responsible for the cybersecurity incident.

Expenses Incurred. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $27.3 million of pretax expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. These expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident and legal and other professional services related thereto, all of which were expensed as incurred.
Contingent Liability. Additionally, as a result of the cybersecurity incident, we are offering free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection to all U.S. consumers. We have concluded that the costs associated with providing this service are a contingent liability that is probable and estimable. We have therefore recorded an estimate of the expenses necessary to provide this service to those who have signed up or will sign up by the January 31, 2018 deadline. We have incurred $4.7 million through September 30, 2017 and have estimated a range of additional costs between $56 million and $110 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification section 450-20-30-1, we have recorded a liability for the low end in the range as we do not believe that any amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.
Litigation, Claims and Government Investigations. As a result of the cybersecurity incident, we are subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in Part II, ""Item 1. Legal Proceedings."" While we believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of such proceedings and investigations based on the early stage of these proceedings and investigations, that alleged damages have not been specified, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues.
Future Costs. We expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the cybersecurity incident in future periods. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the cybersecurity incident that will be incurred in future periods will also include increased expenses and capital investments for IT and security. We expect to incur increased expenses for insurance, finance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. We will also incur increased costs to provide free services to consumers including increased customer support costs.
Insurance Coverage. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the cybersecurity incident. Our coverage has a $7.5 million deductible. As of September 30, 2017, the Company has not recorded a receivable for costs the Company has incurred to date as we have not yet concluded that the costs are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage.",1703400000,125000000.0,125000000,1:18-cv-01069-TWT |  1:18-cv-00317-TWT,King & Spalding LLP | Pepper Hamilton LLP | Robinson & Cole LLP | Snell & Wilmer LLP | Godfrey & Kahn SC | Clark Hill PLC | Gallagher Callahan & Gartrell PA | Verrill & Dana LLP | Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP | Lightfoot Franklin & White LLC | Messerli & Kramer PA | Lax Vaughan Fortson McKenzie & Rowe PA | Jones Walker LLP | Polsinelli PC | Williams Kilpatrick & True PLLC | MHC Law LLC | Wiggins Williams & Wiggins PC | Mee Mee Hoge & Epperson PLLP,Morgan & Morgan | The Barnes Law Group LLC,125637.0,141.38999938964844,111.33999633789062,108.02999877929688,115.69000244140624,122.83000183105469,118.41000366210938,121.38999938964844,117.58000183105469,113.0,124.72000122070312,127.23999786376952,128.05000305175778,135.75999450683594,121.0,122.8

Security company Kromtech found 600GB of unprotected data on an Amazon server last month.
User names, account numbers and other details were discovered.
In a separate accident, files on thousands of Americans with high level security clearances were found on an unsecured Amazon server.
In a blog, Kromtech said the data it had found was about users of Time Warner Cable's MyTWC app, which lets customers manage their account via a smartphone or tablet.
Charter Communications, the parent company of Time Warner Cable, said users' financial information had not been exposed and the data largely concerned former or ""legacy"" customers.
The information had been removed as soon as the company had been told it was visible, Charter told Reuters.
The company said its early analysis suggested the information belonged to Broadsoft - which developed the MyTWC app.
In a statement, Broadsoft said no bank, credit card or other personal data about end users was exposed in the breach. Nor, it said, were any of its core systems left open to scrutiny.
It said: ""As soon as we recognised the exposure, we immediately began to resecure the information.
""We continue to work closely with our customers to ensure the privacy of their data and to assure them that their information and that of their end-users is secure,"" it added.
Dangerous data
The other breach was uncovered by technology news website Gizmodo, which found information on sensitive government workers employed by security company TigerSwan.
It found more than 9,400 documents revealing ""extraordinary details"" about people who had worked for the US Department of Defense and its intelligence agencies.
Also in the exposed data was information about people in Iraq and Afghanistan who had worked with the US military.

Amazon has released tools to help its cloud customers secure data
Security company Upguard, which worked with Gizmodo to analyse the leak, said many people could be ""endangered"" if the information uncovered was widely shared.
In response, TigerSwan said it took information security ""very seriously"", found the exposure ""inexcusable"" and planned to investigate how the data came to be publicly exposed.
It added: ""The situation is rectified, and we have initiated steps to inform the individuals affected by this breach.""
This year has seen a series of breaches involving data uploaded to Amazon's AWS and cloud services.
Verizon, Dow Jones, voting machine maker ES&S and the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) have all had data released this way.
This month, Amazon released a software tool called Macie that automatically scans servers to make sure data is not being inadvertently exposed.
In addition, last month Amazon started sending warnings to its AWS users if it found they had uploaded data that anyone could see.
Independent security expert Graham Cluley said the problem had a ""fundamentally human"" cause.
""On each occasion, it boils down to some noodle-brain unwisely opening up their data buckets to all and sundry, making their contents publicly visible,"" he said.
Shutting off access might not end the sharing of sensitive data, he said.
""Even if companies realise they've accidentally published sensitive data via Amazon and locked up their data buckets, there is always the risk that Google has already indexed and cached the information,"" Mr Cluley said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,393.3200073242188,369.510009765625,335.42999267578125,334.0,353.0299987792969,387.5,332.75,306.3699951171875,271.3599853515625,267.98001098632807,299.510009765625,303.6600036621094,312.989990234375,446.5,446.5

Jonathan Vanian
Aug 30, 2017
Hackers have found a way to breach Instagram.
The Facebook-owned photo sharing service said Wednesday that criminals exploited a software bug that allowed them to access the accounts of an unspecified number of “high-profile” users.
Instagram did not say when exactly it discovered the data breach, only that it was recent. Hackers may have obtained the email addresses and phone numbers of some of the impacted users, but not their passwords, the company said. Additionally, Instagram said it fixed the software bug and is continuing to investigate what happened.
Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.
“At this point we believe this effort was targeted at high-profile users so, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying our verified account holders of this issue,” an Instagram spokesperson told Fortune in a statement.
Earlier this week, entertainment business publication Variety reported that the Instagram account of singer and actress Selena Gomez was hacked. Gomez’s Instagram account was then shut down after hackers posted nude photos of her ex-boyfriend and pop star Justin Bieber on Instagram
Eventually, Gomez’s account was restored after the photos were removed.
Instagram did not say if its recent data breach was related to Gomez’s hacked account and it did not reveal whose accounts were impacted.“As always, we encourage people to be vigilant about the security of their account and exercise caution if they encounter any suspicious activity such as unrecognized incoming calls, texts and emails,” the spokesperson said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,168.0500030517578,170.8699951171875,179.8699951171875,175.1300048828125,176.4600067138672,185.97999572753903,178.32000732421875,159.7899932861328,172.0,185.7400054931641,194.32000732421875,171.05999755859375,175.89999389648438,215.0,211.33333333333331

On July 31, a group calling itself ""31337"" dumped Mandiant information including details on Mandiant's network topology, licenses, and business contracts, as well as the victimized researcher's emails and account credentials.

In response to the initial leak, FireEye claimed the hackers found passwords to those accounts among the millions of credentials stolen and dumped online when social media and email companies were themselves hacked and that all but three internal documents released by the group were either available publicly or fabricated.

We have engaged professionals who have corrected the issue and customers can now safely use their credit and debit cards at the food and beverage and retail locations at the Resort.  This incident did not affect credit and debit cards used to make or pay for hotel reservations or purchases made by guests who charged their food and beverage or retail purchases back to their room.

What Happened?  The Resort began investigating unusual activity after receiving reports from its credit card processor.  The Resort immediately began working with third-party forensic experts to investigate these reports and to identify any signs of compromise on its computer systems.  On May 10, 2017, the Resort confirmed the existence of suspicious files on its computer systems that indicated a potential compromise of customers' credit and debit card data for some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations at the resort. 

The Resort has been working with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information was affected.  The Resort has confirmed that malware may have captured data from some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations at the Resort.  The Resort has removed the malware at issue to contain this incident and implemented additional procedures in an effort to prevent any further unauthorized access to customers' credit and debit card information.  This incident did not affect credit and debit cards used to make or pay for hotel reservations or purchases made by guests who charged their food and beverage or retail purchases back to their room.

What Information Was Involved?  Through the ongoing third-party forensic investigations, the Resort confirmed that malware may have captured credit and debit card data from some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations between November 1, 2016 and April 3, 2017.  The information at risk as a result of this event for credit or debit cards used at the impacted locations includes the card number, expiration date and CVV.  This incident did not involve customers' Social Security numbers as this information is never collected by the Resort.  This incident did not involve customers' names or PIN numbers, either.

What We Are Doing.  ""The Resort takes the security of our customers' information extremely seriously, and we apologize for the inconvenience this incident may have caused our customers,"" Howard C. Karawan, President and Managing Director of Atlantis, Paradise Island, stated.  Mr. Karawan expanded, ""We continue to work with third-party forensic investigators to ensure the security of our systems on behalf of our customers and would like to take this opportunity to remind customers to remain vigilant against fraud by reviewing their financial account statements regularly and reporting any suspicious activity.""

For More Information.  Customers can email notices@atlantisparadise.com for more information regarding this incident.  Customers can also find information on this incident and what they can do to better protect against fraud and identity theft at www.atlantisbahamas.com.

What You Can Do.  The Resort encourages all customers to remain vigilant against identity theft by reviewing their financial account statements regularly and monitoring their credit reports for suspicious activity.  Customers should immediately report any unauthorized charges to their card issuer.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card.  Under U.S. law, individuals over the age of 18 are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus.  To order a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228.  Customers may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of their credit report.

The Resort encourages customers who believe they may be affected by this incident to take additional action to further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss.  At no charge, customers can have these credit bureaus place a ""fraud alert"" on their file, alerting creditors to take additional steps to verify their identity prior to granting credit in their name.  Note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect the customer, a fraud alert may also delay customers' ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies their identity.  As soon as one credit bureau confirms a customer's fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on the customer's file. Should customers wish to place a fraud alert or have any questions regarding their credit reports, they may contact any one of the agencies listed below.

Customers may also place a security freeze on their credit reports.  A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a customer's credit report without the consumer's written authorization.  However, customers should be aware that placing a security freeze on their credit reports may delay, interfere with or prevent the timely approval of any requests they make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.  If a customer has been a victim of identity theft and provides a credit reporting agency with a valid police report, the agency cannot charge the customer to place, lift or remove a security freeze.  In all other cases, a credit reporting agency may charge a fee to place, temporarily lift or permanently remove a security freeze.  Customers will need to place security freezes separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if they wish to place a freeze on all of their credit files.  To find out more about how to place a security freeze, customers can contact the credit reporting agencies using the information below:

Verizon confirmed that 6 million records were compromised by Nice Systems, a Verizon partner that facilitates customer service calls. The records, which held logs from residential customers who had called Verizon customer service in the past six months, were accessed via an unprotected Amazon S3 storage server controlled by an employee of Nice Systems.

CNN reports that the cause was a misconfigured security setting on the server. As a result, anyone who knew the web address could download the files. But Verizon says no other external party had access to the data, telling CNN that no loss or theft of customer information occurred.

Each record included the customer’s name, mobile number, and account PIN, along with their home address, email address, and their Verizon account balance. While some records were partially redacted, most were not. Anyone with access to the records could have theoretically impersonated a subscriber and been granted access to their account.

Verizon and Nice Systems have said they are investigating the breach. Nice also commented that the data was “part of a demo system,” but refused to elaborate. Chris Vickery, a researcher with cybersecurity firm UpGuard, first noticed the breach on June 13th and privately informed Verizon. The data was finally secured on June 22nd, nine days later.

This is certainly not the first time a mobile carrier has suffered a data breach. In 2015, a breach at data broker Experian resulted in the exposure of similar information for 15 million T-Mobile customers. In 2016, hackers stole data from Verizon’s enterprise unit, which provides IT services to companies, and put it up for sale online.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,42.88999938964844,48.06000137329102,46.29999923706055,48.86000061035156,44.88000106811523,51.84000015258789,52.11000061035156,50.11000061035156,48.79999923706055,47.58000183105469,48.61999893188477,49.29999923706055,51.34000015258789,49.0,48.444444444444436

According to WWE, the breach occurred due to vulnerabilities in a now-secured database housed on Amazon Web Services. The company is now working with Amazon Web Services, as well as cybersecurity firms Praetorian and Smartronix, in order to prevent further issues.

The breach, which was initially reported on Tuesday, was uncovered by Bob Dyachenko from security firm Kromtech, who told Forbes that WWE's customer information was sitting on an unprotected server, available to read in plain text by anybody who knew the URL. More than 3,000,000 customers in WWE's database were exposed, with information ranging from their home addresses to ethnicities to the ages and genders of their children readily available.

In WWE's statement, the company was quick to point out that no credit card numbers or passwords were stored on the server, so users didn't have to worry about that information falling into the hands of others.

On June 27, 2017, the Company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations. While the Company does not yet know the magnitude of the impact of the disruption, which remains ongoing in certain operations, it continues to work to minimize the effects.
The Company is in the process of restoring its manufacturing operations. To date, Merck has largely restored its packaging operations and has mostly restored its formulation operations. The Company is in the process of restoring its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient operations but is not yet producing bulk product. The Company’s external manufacturing was not impacted. Throughout this time, Merck has continued to fulfill orders and ship product.
The Company is confident in the continuous supply of key products such as Keytruda, Januvia (sitagliptin) and Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir). In addition, Merck does not currently expect a significant impact to sales of its other top products; however, the Company anticipates that it will have temporary delays in fulfilling orders for certain other products in certain markets. Merck does not currently expect a significant impairment to the value of intangible assets related to marketed products or inventories. Full resumption of affected operations will take time and the Company will incur expenditures related to remediation efforts.

On June 27, 2017, a global malware incident impacted our business. The malware affected a significant portion of our global Windows-based applications and our sales, distribution and financial networks across our business. During the last four days of the second quarter and early third quarter, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact and minimize the damages from the malware and restore our systems. This allowed us to service customer needs and continue sales and production at a reduced capacity while progressing recovery activities. Based on the nature of the malware and its impact to our technology, we did not expect nor to date have we found any instances of Company or personal data released externally. Although we believe we have now largely contained the disruption and restored a majority of our affected systems, we anticipate additional work during the second half of 2017 as we continue to recover and further enhance the security of our systems.
For the second quarter, we estimate that the malware incident had a negative impact of 2.3% on our net revenue growth and 2.4% on our Organic Net Revenue growth. We also incurred incremental expenses of $7.1 million as a result of the incident. We expect to be able to recognize the majority of delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter results, although we permanently lost some revenue. We continue to address the recovery of our systems in a couple of key markets and are also assessing longer-term investments that we will make to strengthen our IT environment against potential future disruptions.

Portions of the network were knocked following the attack, officials told its customers. Nuance is still working through the incident, which includes a major part of its services to healthcare clients.

[Also: Nuance knocked offline by ransomware attacking Europe]

The company is offering Dragon Medical One or Dragon Medical Network Edition as an option for these customers. And officials said customers may also choose to implement an alternative dictation service.

“Today our technical teams are continuing to work on network server recovery, determining the recovery process and timing and other client options,” officials said on the Nuance Twitter account.

The update comes as Comae Technologies and Kaspersky Labs announced NotPetya was not a ransomware attack, but a wiper meant to destroy. The hackers masked the virus as ransomware to distract the media.

[Also: Researchers find Petya ransomware vaccine, but no kill switch]

This is a separate update than the initial report that the German email provider Posteo shut down the email account connected to the ransomware. Without the email address, victims couldn’t contact the hackers to pay the ransom or regain the files.

But that no longer matters.

NotPetya hackers didn’t employ a command-and-control server like standard ransomware strains. Instead, Kaspersky Labs researchers said the hackers use the infection identification to store the data from each infected computer and the decryption key.

The primary goal of NotPetya is to damage and destruct data. While ransomware is capable of restoring data, a wiper excludes restoration possibilities. Comae officials said the latest virus leverages not only the leaked NSA ETERNALBLUE exploit, but also ETERNALROMANCE.

Further, Kaspersky researchers said the key presented on infected computers is fake and randomly generated.

Comae officials said that Microsoft’s initial analysis was accurate, but added the initial attacks that began in Ukarine didn’t just shut down large portions of its systems. NotPetya “trashed the 24 first sector blocks of the disk, while replicating itself.”

The hacker merely took the successful Petya ransomware of 2016 and modified the code set to destruction. Both security firms said that it’s this reason that points to a nation-state actor and not a criminal hacking group.

So far, there have been more than 2,000 attacks in 64 countries. Nuance, biopharma giant Merck and a large Pennsylvania health system have been in the hardest hit in the U.S., while Ukraine has faced the most interruptions. India, Brazil, Denmark and Russia were also targeted.

HIMSS is tracking Petya/NotPetya updates, which include how users can tell if their system has been compromised and how to patch the CVE-2017-0144 vulnerability. Much like the FBI and security experts, HIMSS confirmed organizations should not pay the ransom, and Petya is a damage/destruction virus.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002517/000100251717000021/0001002517-17-000021-index.htm,2017-08-08 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002517/000100251717000024/0001002517-17-000024-index.htm,Footnotes | MDA | Risk Factors,2017-08-09 00:00:00,"Malware Incident
On June 27, 2017, Nuance was a victim of the global NotPetya malware incident (the “Malware Incident”). The NotPetya malware affected certain Nuance systems, including systems used by our healthcare customers, primarily for transcription services, as well as systems used by our imaging division to receive and process orders. We believe that we lost approximately $15.4 million in revenue in the third quarter to our healthcare and imaging businesses during the last days of the quarter as a result of the disruption from the Malware Incident. In addition, during the third quarter we also incurred expenses of $5.2 million related to remediation and restoration efforts as well as charges related to the impairment of certain impacted fixed assets.
While the Company has made significant progress in remediating systems related to the Malware Incident, we nonetheless expect a material effect on the fourth quarter financial results.

FedEx, however, said no data breach was known to have occurred.

The company said it was unable to measure the financial impact of the service disruption at TNT, but it could be ""material"".

The Netherlands-based TNT Express said on Tuesday it was experiencing interference with some of its systems, following a global ransomware attack.

The ransomware attack on Tuesday hit computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukraine's international airport, global shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) and the world's biggest advertising agency WPP (WPP.L).

FedEx said it was implementing remediation steps and contingency plans as quickly as possible.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/000119312517216213/0001193125-17-216213-index.htm,2017-06-28 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/000095012317006152/0000950123-17-006152-index.htm,Risk Factors | Controls,2017-07-17 00:00:00,"TNT Express experienced a significant cyber-attack in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and we are not yet able to determine the full extent of its impact, including the impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and it is likely that the financial impact will be material.
On June 28, 2017, we announced that the worldwide operations of TNT Express were significantly affected by the cyber-attack known as Petya, which involved the spread of an information technology virus that infiltrated TNT Express systems and encrypted its data. While TNT Express operations have been restored and most TNT services are currently available, as of the date of this filing, we cannot estimate when TNT Express services will be fully restored. In addition, we cannot estimate how long it will take to restore the systems that were impacted and it is reasonably possible that TNT Express will be unable to fully restore all of the affected systems and recover all of the critical business data that was encrypted.
Given the recent timing and magnitude of the attack, in addition to our initial focus on restoring TNT Express operations and customer service functions, we are still evaluating the financial impact of the attack, but it is likely that it will be material. The following consequences or potential consequences of the cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition:
•
loss of revenue resulting from the operational disruption immediately following the cyber-attack;
 
•
loss of revenue or increased bad debt expense due to the inability to invoice properly;
 
•
loss of revenue due to permanent customer loss;
 
•
remediation costs to restore systems;
 
•
increased operational costs due to contingency plans that remain in place;
 
•
investments in enhanced systems in order to prevent future attacks;
 
•
cost of incentives offered to customers to restore confidence and maintain business relationships;
 
•
reputational damage resulting in the failure to retain or attract customers;
 
•
costs associated with potential litigation or governmental investigations;
 
•
costs associated with any data breach or data loss to third parties that is discovered;
 
•
costs associated with the potential loss of critical business data;
 
•
longer and more costly integration (due to increased expenses and capital spending requirements) of TNT Express and FedEx Express; and
 
•
other consequences of which we are not currently aware but will discover through the remediation process.

""No data breach is known to have occurred.""Maersk issued a similar statement on Tuesday, saying its tech systems ""are down across multiple sites and business units due to a cyberattack.""Related: What is ransomware?The U.S.-based pharmaceutical company Merck (MRK) also said it was hit.""We confirm our company's computer network was compromised today as part of global hack,"" Merck said on Twitter.Mondelez (MDLZ), the company that owns Oreos, Cadbury and many other global snack brands, reported a computer outage across its global operations. And law firm DLA Piper said it had taken down its systems in response to ""a serious global cyber incident.""The source of the attack is not yet clear. It is similar to WannaCry, which spread globally in May, but there are differences. Both asked victims to pay Bitcoin to get their files back, and both use a similar flaw to spread through networks.Related: Why WannaCry took down so many businessesThe Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Group IB estimated Tuesday that the virus affected about 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine.Group IB said the ransomware infects and locks a computer, and then demands a $300 ransom to be paid in Bitcoins.Many firms, including Symantec, have suggested the ransomware is a variant of Petya, a known ransomware. But according to security firm Kaspersky Lab, preliminary findings indicate the attacks are from a new ransomware that it's now calling ""ExPetr.""Either way, researchers say Tuesday's attacks use a Windows flaw called EternalBlue to spread through corporate networks. WannaCry also leveraged the EternalBlue exploit, which was leaked as part of a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) issued a patches for the exploits in March.Microsoft said it found that the ransomware is using multiple techniques to spread, including one that was addressed by the security patch released in March. It is continuing to investigate.Related: Attack sparks debate on when spy agencies should disclose cyber holesThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security is also monitoring the cyberattacks.Spokesman Scott McConnell said DHS is ""coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners. We stand ready to support any requests for assistance.""Europol said it is investigating the attack as well.Ukrainian companies and government agencies seem to have been hit particularly hard.Ukraine's central bank warned financial firms across the country that an unknown virus hit the sector, creating problems for banks and customer service.According to security firm Cisco Talos, the ransomware initially infected MeDoc, a piece of Ukranian accounting software. MeDoc then sent an infected file to customers. It spread to other computers on companies' networks by leveraging software holes.Ukrainian officials confirmed a possible link to MeDoc. But the company denied its software spread the infection, saying in a Facebook post that an update sent out last week was free of viruses.This ransomware was much more advanced than WannaCry, according to Craig Williams, senior tech lead and security outreach manager at Cisco Talos.Related: The hero who accidentally stopped the WannaCry cyberattack from spreadingOfficials at Ukraine's postal service and metro system in Kiev also reported hacking problems.Ukraine's vice prime minister, Pavlo Rozenko, tweeted a screenshot of his malfunctioning computer saying computers at the Cabinet of Ministers had been affected.The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was also hit by the cyber attack, according to a Ukrainian federal agency. In a statement, the agency said that ""in connection with the cyber attack, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant website is not working."" Its Microsoft Windows systems were temporarily disconnected, and radiation monitoring in the area of the industrial site is being carried out manually, it said.Ransomware victims are always advised not to pay the ransom to get their files back because it encourages the attackers.

Happened?
On May 16, 2017, Jewelry.com discovered that beginning on or about November 16, 2016,
unknown individuals gained access to our online boutique through the unauthorized use of
an account belonging to one of our employees. Unfortunately, and despite all the security
measures implemented on the website, the intruders were able to install malicious software on
the Jewelry.com website which was used to capture credit card payment information as it was
entered on our shopping cart page. The intruders were able to access information associated
with online purchases through our Jewelry.com website between November 16, 2016 and May
1, 2017. The compromised information includes debit and credit card numbers, card holders’
names, card holders’ billing addresses, passwords, security codes and expiration dates. While
not all debit and credit cards used during this time period were necessarily affected, out of
an abundance of caution we are notifying you of this incident. We believe that the intruders
accessed approximately 7,000 debit and credit card numbers and related information affecting
approximately 619 California customers.

Was Involved?
Information used to make online purchases:
• Customer Names and Billing Addresses • Debit and Credit Card Numbers • Passwords, Security Codes and Expiration Dates.
What We
Are Doing.
Immediately following the discovery of the data security breach, we removed the malicious
software from the Jewelry.com website, the compromised employee account was terminated, and
the affected computer was disabled and unplugged from the company’s network. We also have
taken additional steps to contain the breach and to enhance the security of the company’s network.
We have retained the law firm of McCarter & English, LLP to assist with remediating the issue and

Notification of Security Incident

We became aware that The Buckle, Inc. was a victim of a security incident in which a criminal entity accessed some guest credit card information following purchases at some of our retail stores. We immediately launched a thorough investigation and engaged leading third party forensic experts to review our systems and secure the affected part of our network.

Through that investigation we learned that our store payment data systems were infected with a form of malicious code, which was quickly removed. Based on the forensic investigation, we believe that no social security numbers, email addresses or physical addresses were obtained by those criminally responsible. There is also no evidence that the buckle.com website or buckle.com guests were impacted.

All Buckle stores had EMV (“chip card”) technology enabled during the time that the incident occurred and we believe the exposure of cardholder data that can be used to create counterfeit cards is limited. However, it is possible that certain credit card numbers may have been compromised.

We take the protection of payment card data very seriously. We are cooperating fully with card brands and forensic investigation services. Any affected individuals either have or will likely receive communications from their issuing banks with additional instructions and/or replacement cards. In line with best practice, we recommend that individuals closely monitor their payment card account statements. If there are unauthorized charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank. Additional details on the incident, as well as steps that you can take to protect your personal information, are set forth below.

 

What Happened

Buckle identified malware on certain Buckle retail store location point-of-sale (POS) systems. This malware apparently was designed to record payment card data (including account number, account holder’s name, and expiration date) from cards used in the affected POS devices in Buckle retail stores. Buckle believes that certain payment cards used in its stores between October 28, 2016 and April 14, 2017 may have been affected. Buckle currently believes that the malware did not collect data from all transactions or all POS systems for each day within that time period.

What Information Was Involved

The malware searched for track data read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card (which, based on the forensic artifacts Buckle has been able to review, sometimes included cardholder name in addition to card number and expiration date). There is no indication that other guest information was collected and no indication that any information submitted through Buckle.com was affected.

What We Are Doing

Buckle promptly engaged forensic experts who performed a detailed investigation of Buckle’s environment. As part of Buckle’s response, connections between Buckle’s network and potentially malicious external IP addresses were blocked, potentially compromised systems were isolated, and malware-related files residing on Buckle’s systems were eradicated. Additionally, Buckle reported a potential incident to the payment card brands and is cooperating with them regarding this incident. 

What You Can Do

It is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.

On June 16, 2017, the Company announced that it became aware that it was a victim of a data security incident in which a criminal entity accessed certain guest credit card information following purchases at some of the Company's retail stores between October 28, 2016 and April 14, 2017. The Company immediately launched a thorough investigation and engaged leading third-party forensic experts to review its systems and secure the affected part of its network. Through that investigation, the Company learned that its store payment data systems were infected with a form of malicious code, which was quickly removed. The Company has taken actions that it believes have contained the issue and has implemented additional security enhancements, and will continue to work vigilantly to pursue this matter to resolution. Based on the forensic investigation, the Company believes that no social security numbers, email addresses, or physical addresses were obtained by those criminally responsible. There is also no evidence that the buckle.com website or buckle.com guests were impacted.

Buckle self-reported the issue to the payment card brands and is cooperating fully with the card brands, their forensic experts, and law enforcement and the investigation is continuing. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential assessments, fines, penalties, or other liabilities in connection with this incident.",0,,,,,,,17.5,16.600000381469727,13.699999809265135,15.75,15.399999618530273,19.0,22.70000076293945,20.0,21.950000762939453,18.25,22.649999618530273,25.0,26.20000076293945,15.0,15.0

(“OSG”) greatly values the relationship we have with you and
understands the importance of protecting your personal information. We are writing to inform
you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our third party vendors that may have
involved some of your information. This data security incident did not impact the OSG network,
but the third party vendor that was the victim of this attack had some OSG data on its servers at
the time of attack. At this time, there is reason to believe that some limited personal information
may have been acquired. In an abundance of caution we are bringing this incident to your
attention to make you aware of this matter and to identify steps you can take to protect yourself.
What Happened?
On April 18, 2017, we discovered that an OSG third party vendor, JiBe, LLC (“JiBe”), was the
victim of a cyberattack. JiBe had been recently engaged by OSG to develop software tools for
operational ship management tasks. At this time, JiBe continues to seek confirmation of the full
scope of any OSG data that may have been accessed. This matter has been reported to law
enforcement.
What Information Was Involved?
While this matter is still under investigation, in an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you
so you can take steps to protect your information. The information we believe that may have
been accessed during this attack included your name, address, and Social Security Number.
OSG never provided JiBe with your bank account information, credit or debit account
information, date of birth, passport or identification number, online account information,
including usernames and passwords, health insurance information, biometric information, or
digitized signature.
What We Are Doing
We wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. We have no
evidence indicating that your personally identifiable information has been used, nonetheless, we
are informing those possibly impacted. JiBe is investigating to determine the scope of
information that may have been accessed during the cyberattack. We also are in

This time though, its chip-and-PIN card readers significantly contained the fallout.

Kmart is not saying how many of its 750 stores in the US were affected by the point-of-sale (PoS) malware, but it stressed that no personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security Numbers or email addresses, was stolen. It also talked up its EMV reader implementation.

Kmart has EMV-enabled terminals in its stores, forcing customers with chip cards to insert their cards instead of swiping their stripes, which minimized the impact of the infection. Still, as independent researcher Brian Krebs reported, those consumers without chip cards could feel significant effects:

“The malware copies account data stored on the card’s magnetic stripe,” he explained. “Armed with that information, thieves can effectively clone the cards and use them to buy high-priced merchandise from electronics stores and big box retailers.”

Several financial institutions flagged the breach to Krebs, indicating that fraud is indeed occurring as a result of the attack, though again, no details are available as to how widespread the impact is.

The incident has no relation to previous breaches, the bargain retailer said in an FAQ, noting that it’s confident that it was successful in eradicating any residual traces of malware or persistence left behind by earlier attacks. Instead, its payment systems were infected with malware that Kmart says was “undetectable” by its antivirus protections.

“Does this mean that we may be dealing with an entirely new family of malware or methods of infecting POS terminals, or that the solution they were using was unable to detect the threat?” said Richard Henderson, Global Security Strategist, Absolute, via email. “If the former, then it will be absolutely critical for Kmart to get information about this attack to other retailers, antivirus companies and network security appliance vendors so that everyone can both look for indicators of compromise inside their own networks and bolster defenses against this new threat.”

If a hole was simply found in KMart's defenses, it brings up the need for a defense-in-depth approach, he added.

The incident was a passing test for the PCI DSS standard of payment security as well, some said.

""This is another example what cybersecurity experts are saying day by day: no IT systems can stay safe if they hold something valuable,” said Csaba Krasznay, product evangelist at Balabit, in a note. “More than 10 years ago, T.J. Maxx suffered a very similar data breach when approximately 100 million cards’ data was stolen. That incident helped the drive for credit-card companies to introduce PCI DSS as a mandatory security standard for everyone who manages card data. If Kmart was really able to avoid large scale data leakage, then we can be sure that PCI DSS is mature and useful enough in these circumstances, at this point.""",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1548309/000154830917000056/0001548309-17-000056-index.htm,2017-06-01 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1548309/000154830917000062/0001548309-17-000062-index.htm,Other,2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Sears Holdings announced on May 31, 2017 that its Kmart store payment-data systems had been infected with a malicious code and that the code had been removed and the event contained",0,,,,,,,7.389999866485598,8.859999656677246,8.720000267028809,8.210000038146973,7.300000190734862,5.510000228881836,4.079999923706056,3.5799999237060547,2.5699999332427983,2.4200000762939453,2.6700000762939453,2.990000009536743,2.809999942779541,,

The company said Friday that it closed the online portal for medical claims and other customer information while it examined a ""security vulnerability."" It's not clear how many patient records might have been exposed and for how long. The company has more than 4.8 million customers in 12 states and Puerto Rico.

""We are in the process of conducting an internal investigation to determine the impact, if any, to our customers' information and will provide any applicable notifications to customers and/or regulatory authorities,"" Molina said in a statement Friday. ""Protecting our members' information is of utmost importance.""

Brian Krebs, a well-known cybersecurity expert who runs the Krebs on Security website, said he notified the company of the potential breach earlier this month and wrote about it on his website Thursday. Molina said it was already aware of the security vulnerability when contacted.

Until recently, Krebs said, Molina ""was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire internet without requiring any authentication.""

Krebs said the information he saw online included patients' names, addresses, dates of birth and information on their medical procedures and medications.

""It's unconscionable that such a basic, security 101 flaw could still exist at a major health care provider,"" Krebs said. ""This information is more sensitive than credit card data, but it seems less protected.""

Krebs said he received an anonymous tip in April from a Molina member who stumbled upon the problem when trying to view his medical claim online. The tipster found that by changing a single number in the website address he could then view other patient claims, according to Krebs.

Krebs said the Molina member showed him screenshots of his own medical records and how when he changed the web address slightly it then displayed records of another patient. On Friday, the Molina website told customers that the online portal was ""under maintenance.""

Health care companies, hospitals and other providers must report data breaches to U.S. officials. Molina emphasized that it was still investigating the matter so had not yet reported it. Federal regulators can levy significant fines for violations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

Many security experts question the ability of health care companies and providers to safeguard vast troves of electronic medical records and other sensitive data, particularly at a time when cybercriminals are targeting medical information.

Molina, based in Long Beach, Calif., posted $17.8 billion in annual revenue last year.

Molina made news earlier this month with the surprise firing of its top two executives, who are sons of the company's founder. Both CEO J. Mario Molina and his brother, finance chief John Molina, were ousted. The company's board said Molina's disappointing financial performance led to the management change.

Molina has grown more prominent during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, as Medicaid expanded and state insurance exchanges launched. The company serves more than 1 million people through Obamacare exchanges across several states. It has nearly 69,000 enrollees in the Covered California exchange, or about 5 percent of the market.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,66.87000274658203,71.0999984741211,69.70999908447266,62.02999877929688,65.58999633789061,65.52999877929689,75.08000183105469,75.86000061035156,92.48999786376952,74.0,76.66000366210938,83.5999984741211,87.2300033569336,21.8,40.24090909090909

during various time periods from January 4, 2016 through March 29, 2017. Upon learning of the unauthorized
access, TALX and Allegis worked together promptly to understand what happened, and determined that, in some
instances, the unauthorized third-party(ies) successfully answered personal questions about the affected employees
in order to reset the employees’ PINs (i.e., the password to access the online portal).
We have no indication that either TALX or Allegis was the source of any of the information used to reset the PINs
and access the accounts. While we are continuing to investigate the incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are
notifying a broad group of individuals who may have been affected.
What Information Was Involved
An unauthorized third-party(ies) may have accessed an electronic copy of your W-2 tax form, which includes your
name, address, Social Security number, and earnings information. The unauthorized third-party(ies) may have also
accessed other information maintained in your online portal account, including your name, address, phone number,
date of birth, Social Security number, wage and direct deposit information, employee identification number, email
address, gender, and marital status.
What We Are Doing
We have notified federal law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and state tax authorities of the
incident, who we understand will monitor affected individuals’ accounts for the purposes of attempting to prevent
fraudulent tax refunds. 
R6232 v.05 05.10.2017
To help prevent recurrence of this type of incident, TALX has implemented additional security measures, including
enhanced fraud monitoring. In addition, TALX has reset your PIN to the original default PIN assigned by Allegis,
removed unverified contact information (email addresses and phone numbers) associated with your account, and
added valid contact information from Allegis, where available, for the purpose of resetting your PIN. To access
your account, you will need to go to the websites listed above and log-in with your employee ID. You will then be
prompted to choose the best available contact method and verify your identity by receiving a one-time-passcode
(“OTP”) to the email or phone number supplied by Allegis if one was available. Once you access your online portal
account, we encourage you to create a new PIN for your account and ensure that your contact information is up to
date. If you are unable to reset your PIN with the OTP option or you otherwise cannot access your online portal
account, please call the TALX Customer Service Center at 1-888-594-3729.

The company has confirmed the data breach after tracking the phishing campaign on May 9. In a statement, the company said:

“Last week and again this morning, DocuSign detected an increase in phishing emails sent to some of our customers and users – and we posted alerts here on the DocuSign Trust Site and in social media. The emails “spoofed” the DocuSign brand in an attempt to trick recipients into opening an attached Word document that, when clicked, installs malicious software.”

DocuSign confirmed that a malicious third party gained access to a “separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email.” In attempts to reassure customers, the eSignature firm stated that only email addresses had been accessed and no names, addresses, passwords, social security numbers, or credit card data had been compromised.

“Malicious email attachments are a critical threat as they can easily bypass traditional defences as part of sophisticated spear-phishing attacks,” said Steven Malone from Minecast.

“All DocuSign customers need to educate users to be extra vigilant when opening any documents purporting to be from their service. Verify with the sender before opening any documents or clicking on any links. Criminals will try all manner of ways to trick employees into enabling macros in weaponized email attachments.”

The company has since put further security controls in place and is currently working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the breach. The company has also advised customers to delete any emails with the subject line as follows:

“We are releasing a significant portion of Bell.ca’s data due to the fact that they have failed to [co-operate] with us,” says the post, which was published Monday afternoon, several hours before Bell released its apology.
“This shows how Bell doesn’t care for its [customers’] safety and they could have avoided this public announcement… Bell, if you don’t [co-operate] more will leak :).” The post contains a link purporting to contain the customer information. It does not clarify what the anonymous poster was seeking co-operation for, or any further intent.

WannaCry: How to protect yourself, what’s happened so far and what could happen next
The telecom company has been aware of its data breach since at least last Wednesday but did not disclose details publicly until several hours after the anonymous post on Monday. 
Bell says that the attacks were not related to the “WannaCry” ransomware attack that spread across the globe late last week. The global cyberattack hit hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, encrypting their data for a ransom of about $300 (U.S.) in the digital currency bitcoin. While the Bell breach was not connected to the broader attack, digital security breaches have become increasingly rampant in Canada and around the world, prompting many companies and security experts to encourage consumers to regularly change passwords and be vigilant in online activities.
“There is no indication that any financial, password or other sensitive personal information was accessed,” the company said in a statement. “Bell took immediate steps to secure affected systems. The company has been working closely with the RCMP cybercrime unit in its investigation and has informed the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.”
Bell notified the commissioner’s office of the breach on May 10, and had planned to make customers aware of the situation once it had more details. “We are following up with the company with respect to what took place and what it is doing to mitigate the situation,” a spokesperson for the commissioner’s office told The Globe. “We expect a formal written breach report from Bell very soon.”
The spokesperson said by e-mail that they could not provide further details or an interview because of confidentiality provisions in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s federal private-sector privacy law.
Bell has been contacting affected customers directly to apologize for the situation, noting that it has worked with government and law enforcement to investigate. The company said in e-mails to customers that “there is minimal risk involved” in this data breach but encouraged them to regularly change passwords and security questions and to avoid suspicious e-mails and communications. “Please note that Bell will never ask for your credit card or other personal information by e-mail,” it said.
The company declined to comment on the specifics of the attack, citing security reasons and the ongoing police investigation.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718940/000130901417000419/exhibit1.htm,2017-05-15 00:00:00,ND,,,,,,,,,,,44.790000915527344,44.86000061035156,45.959999084472656,46.52999877929688,47.36999893188477,47.349998474121094,48.349998474121094,48.34000015258789,46.45000076293945,44.47999954223633,43.47000122070313,42.75,42.18999862670898,62.0,62.0

The DU Caller app released by the DU Group, a subsidiary of Baidu, a large Chinese search engine and web services company, was originally marketed as a call-blocking tool, and became enormously popular, boasting a userbase of over 1 billion searchable contacts.

Tip of the Iceberg: Extent of #Vault7 Leak 'Shocking', More to Come
According to a new report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the free app apparently paid for itself by secretly transferring user data, including the user's contacts, to proprietary servers for unknown reasons.

A reverse lookup function in the app allowed anyone with the app to access Baidu's servers in Beijing, and after the contacts were leaked, the information was revealed to include some high-profile names.

Hong Kong Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok, Hong Kong Police Chief Stephen Lo Wai-chung and many other party officials from the central government's liaison office were shown to have had their data compromised, according to SCMP.

The case has been referred by the security bureau to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data in Beijing for investigation.

Prior to a user agreeing to the privacy policy of the free app — and immediately after installing the app, according to the report — DU Caller would gather personal data and transfer it to Baidu servers in Beijing.

Accessed for download from the Google Play store, the app, which has been downloaded somewhere between one and five million times, is not available for Apple iPhones, according to SCMP.

Hong Kong's privacy commissioner for personal data, Stephen Wong Kai-yi, was on the list of those whose information was leaked, and asserted that the developer of DU Caller was in breach of the country's third data protection principle of its Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,186.13999938964844,179.19000244140625,186.9199981689453,223.69000244140625,236.41000366210938,262.67999267578125,237.3699951171875,233.2400054931641,253.0399932861328,225.6000061035156,258.35000610351557,228.1699981689453,272.260009765625,1617.985,1617.985

The app’s producer Atlassian says it has contacted all affected users, however all users should still change passwords.

In a blog post, HipChat mentions that all passwords are now invalidated on all HipChat-connected user accounts affected by the breach. HipChat users who do not receive an email with password reset instructions have not been affected by the breach. 

According to Stay Smart Online, the breach involved potential unauthorised access to sensitive data, although there is no evidence of access to financial or credit card information. There is also no evidence that any other Atlassian system or product was affected by the breach.

According to the blog post, the breach focused on four areas:

“For all instances (each of which is represented by a unique url—e.g. company.hipchat.com), the attacker may have accessed user account information (including name, email address and hashed password). HipChat hashes passwords using bcrypt with a random salt. Room metadata (including room name and room topic) may have also been accessed.

For a small number of instances (less than 0.05%), messages and content in rooms may have been accessed. We are contacting and will work closely with these customers.

For the vast majority of instances (more than 99.95%), we have found no evidence that messages or content in rooms have been accessed.""

The company has isolated all affected systems and blocked any unauthorised access. The company is also working with law enforcement in ongoing investigation.

Stay Smart Online recommends that when a data breach happens, users should change passwords, monitor accounts for suspicious activity and seek advice from the vendor.

Today, travel industry giant Sabre Corp. disclosed what could be a significant breach of payment and customer data tied to bookings processed through a reservations system that serves more than 32,000 hotels and other lodging establishments.

sabreIn a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, Southlake, Texas-based Sabre said it was “investigating an incident of unauthorized access to payment information contained in a subset of hotel reservations processed through our Hospitality Solutions SynXis Central Reservations system.”

According to Sabre’s marketing literature, more than 32,000 properties use Sabre’s SynXis reservations system, described as an inventory management Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that “enables hoteliers to support a multitude of rate, inventory and distribution strategies to achieve their business goals.”

Sabre said it has engaged security forensics firm Mandiant to support its investigation, and that it has notified law enforcement.

“The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity,” reads a brief statement that Sabre sent to affected properties today. “There is no reason to believe that any other Sabre systems beyond SynXis Central Reservations have been affected.”

Sabre’s software, data, mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace, which processes more than $110 billion of estimated travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers.

Sabre told customers that it didn’t have any additional details about the breach to share at this time, so it remains unclear what the exact cause of the breach may be or for how long it may have persisted.

A card involving traveler transactions for even a small percentage of the 32,000 properties that are using Sabre’s impacted technology could jeopardize a significant number of customer credit cards in a short amount of time.

The news comes amid revelations about a blossoming breach at Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG), the parent company that manages some 5,000 hotels worldwide, including Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express.

KrebsOnSecurity first reported in December 2016 that cards used at IHG properties were being sold to fraudsters, but it took until February 2017 for IHG to announce it had found malicious software installed at front-desk systems at just a dozen of its properties. On April 18, IHG disclosed in an update on the investigation that more than 1,200 properties were affected, and that there could well be more added in the coming days.

According to Verizon‘s latest annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), malware attacks on point-of-sale systems used at front desk and hotel restaurant systems “are absolutely rampant” in the hospitality sector. Accommodation was the top industry for point-of-sale intrusions in this year’s data, with 87% of breaches within that pattern.

“Apparently, it is not only The Eagles that are destined for a long stay at the hotel,” Verizon mused in its report. “The hackers continue to be checked in indefinitely as well. Breach timelines continue to paint a rather dismal picture—with time-to-compromise being only seconds, time-to-exfiltration taking days, and times to discovery and containment staying firmly in the months camp.”

Card-stealing cyber thieves have broken into some of the largest hotel chains over the past few years. Hotel brands that have acknowledged card breaches over the last year after prompting by KrebsOnSecurity include Kimpton Hotels, Trump Hotels (twice), Hilton, Mandarin Oriental, and White Lodging (twice). Card breaches also have hit hospitality chains Starwood Hotels and Hyatt. 

In many of those incidents, thieves planted malicious software on the point-of-sale devices at restaurants and bars inside of the hotel chains. Point-of-sale based malware has driven most of the credit card breaches over the past two years, including intrusions at Target and Home Depot, as well as breaches at a slew of point-of-sale vendors. The malicious code usually is installed via hacked remote administration tools. Once the attackers have their malware loaded onto the point-of-sale devices, they can remotely capture data from each card swiped at that cash register.

Thieves can then sell that data to crooks who specialize in encoding the stolen data onto any card with a magnetic stripe, and using the cards to purchase high-priced electronics and gift cards from big-box stores like Target and Best Buy.

Readers should remember that they’re not liable for fraudulent charges on their credit or debit cards, but they still have to report the unauthorized transactions. There is no substitute for keeping a close eye on your card statements. Also, consider using credit cards instead of debit cards; having your checking account emptied of cash while your bank sorts out the situation can be a hassle and lead to secondary problems (bounced checks, for instance).

(LAST UPDATED APRIL 25, 2017)

We want to make our customers aware that we recently detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for purchases made in our restaurants. We immediately began an investigation with the help of leading cyber security firms, law enforcement, and our payment processor. We believe actions we have taken have stopped the unauthorized activity, and we have implemented additional security enhancements. Our investigation is focused on card transactions in our restaurants that occurred from March 24, 2017 through April 18, 2017. Because our investigation is continuing, complete findings are not available and it is too early to provide further details on the investigation. We anticipate providing notification to any affected customers as we get further clarity about the specific timeframes and restaurant locations that may have been affected.

Consistent with good practices, consumers should closely monitor their payment card statements. If anyone sees an unauthorized charge, they should immediately notify the bank that issued the card. Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058090/000105809017000021/0001058090-17-000021-index.htm,Risk Factors,2017-04-26 00:00:00,"We may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information. 
We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2016 approximately 70% of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions, and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase. A number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers in recent years. 
In April 2017, our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants, and immediately began an investigation with the help of leading computer security firms. We self-reported the issue to payment card processors and law enforcement agencies and the investigation is continuing. While the investigation is ongoing, we have implemented additional security enhancements, and will continue to work vigilantly to pursue this matter to resolution. However, we could be subject to material card assessments, fines or penalties in connection with this matter. 
We may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to this incident or any future incidents in which payment card data may have been compromised. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit), or federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.  
We are also required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees, and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, by the European Union and its member states, and by the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. At the same time, we are increasingly relying on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf. We have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of several of these systems. If the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.

April 14, 2017

California residents please click here


IHG values the relationship we have with our guests and understands the importance of protecting payment card data.  Many IHG-branded locations are independently owned and operated franchises, and certain of these franchisee operated locations in the Americas were made aware by payment card networks of patterns of unauthorized charges occurring on payment cards after they were legitimately used at their locations.  To ensure an efficient and effective response, IHG hired a leading cyber security firm on behalf of franchisees to coordinate an examination of the payment card processing systems of franchise hotel locations in the Americas region.

The investigation identified signs of the operation of malware designed to access payment card data from cards used onsite at front desks for certain IHG-branded franchise hotel locations between September 29, 2016 and December 29, 2016.   Although there is no evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data after December 29, 2016, confirmation that the malware was eradicated did not occur until the properties were investigated in February and March 2017.  Before this incident began, many IHG-branded franchise hotel locations had implemented IHG’s Secure Payment Solution (SPS), a point-to-point encryption payment acceptance solution.  Properties that had implemented SPS before September 29, 2016 were not affected.  Many more properties implemented SPS after September 29, 2016, and the implementation of SPS ended the ability of the malware to find payment card data and, therefore, cards used at these locations after SPS implementation were not affected.

The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected hotel server. There is no indication that other guest information was affected.  A list of affected IHG franchise locations and respective time frames, which may vary by location, is available here.

It is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.  Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take.

On behalf of franchisees, IHG has been working closely with the payment card networks as well as with the cyber security firm to confirm that the malware has been eradicated and evaluate ways for franchisees to enhance security measures.  Law enforcement has also been notified. 

We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.  If you have questions, and reside in the United States, please call 855-330-6367 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET, Monday to Friday.

In 2016, the Group was notified of (a) a security incident at a number of Kimpton hotels that resulted in unauthorised access to guest payment card data (the Kimpton Security Incident), and (b) a security incident that involved malware being installed on servers that processed payment cards used at restaurants and bars of 12 IHG managed properties (the Americas Security incident), together the Security Incidents.  A provision of $5m was made at 31 December 2016, and remains in place at 31 December 2017, to cover the estimated cost of reimbursing the impacted card networks for counterfeit fraud losses and related expenses.  At 31 December 2017, this estimate relates to both the Kimpton and Americas Security Incidents whereas at 31 December 2016 it was Kimpton related only.  The estimates continue to involve significant judgement based on currently available information and remain subject to change as actual claims are made and new information comes to light.
 
The Group may be exposed to investigations regarding compliance with applicable State and Federal data security standards, and legal action from individuals and organisations impacted by the Security Incidents.  Due to the general nature of the regulatory enquiries received and class action filings to date, it is not practicable to make a reliable estimate of the possible financial effects of any such claims on the Group at this time.  To date, four lawsuits have been filed against IHG entities relating to the Security Incidents, all of which are in the early stages of litigation.
 
In respect of the $5m provision, it is expected that a proportion will be recoverable under the Group's insurance programmes although this, together with any potential recoveries in respect of the contingent liabilities detailed above, will be subject to specific agreement with the relevant insurance providers.",5000000,,,1:17-cv-01622,,,,53.95328903198242,57.96628189086914,59.336143493652344,58.64067459106445,54.78398132324219,53.16122055053711,57.59746932983398,59.37829208374024,63.38250732421875,69.18862152099611,67.78714752197266,67.31295776367189,63.53003311157226,55.647,57.58750000000001

A third party notified the company of the potential breach
Apr 7, 2017, 4:20 pm EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer
GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) may be the latest company to have been hit by a data breach.

GameStop Data BreachThe video game store chain’s information may have been compromised due to hackers accessing their servers. Here’s what we know:

A third party notified GameStop that someone was selling what they believe to be information of GameStop’s customers.
The specific details are not 100% clear yet, but it is believed that the credit card information of these users has been stolen.
This includes their names, card numbers, expiration dates, addresses and security codes on the back.
A security firm has been hired by GameStop to investigate these claims.
“The chain has and will continue to work non-stop to address this report and take appropriate measures to eradicate any issue that may be identified,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.
There is no evidence to suggest that the company’s retail locations were affected by the data breach.
GameStop asked its customers to take a close look at their credit card statement to ensure there were no funky charges.

The fast-food company noted that the site does not collect social insurance numbers, banking information or health information. The breach seemed to have occurred in mid-March this year, McDonald's said.

""McDonald's Canada monitors its databases for any unauthorized access,"" the company said in a statement. ""This monitoring identified unauthorized access to the database.

""When we learned of this privacy breach we immediately shut down the site and launched an investigation. The careers website will remain shut until the investigation is complete and appropriate measures are taken to ensure that this type of security breach does not happen again.

""We apologize to those impacted by this incident.""

The firm said they also ""took steps to quarantine the affected database"" to prevent further exposure and notified privacy commissioners in every jurisdiction about the security breach.

However, McDonald's Canada said there is currently no evidence that the information taken has been misused. Applicants affected by the breach will be notified soon. Meanwhile, anyone interested in applying for a job can do so in person at any of its Canadian restaurants, the company said.

The popular fast food giant currently has over 1,400 restaurants in Canada and more than 80,000 Canadian employees.

In March, McDonald's India urged users to update the McDelivery app on their devices as a precautionary measure after an independent security firm warned that it was leaking personal data of more than 2.2 million users including names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, home co-ordinates and social profile links.

The same month, McDonald's said one of its official Twitter feeds was ""hacked by an external source"" when it sent out a tweet trolling President Donald Trump.

""@realDonaldTrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands,"" the tweet read before it was swiftly deleted.

""Twitter notified us that our account was compromised,"" the company said later.

We are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, technologies supporting McDonald’s delivery and digital solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions.
Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. The third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business, including the credit risk of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations.
Furthermore, security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers.

Fallible claims that “an unprotected publicly accessible API endpoint for getting user details coupled with serially enumerable integers as customer IDs can be used to obtain access to all users personal information.” 

McDonald’s India was quick to get into damage control mode and said that there’s no sensitive data stored within its app or websites. However, since each customer ID has the contact number as well as the addresses in some cases, this could turn out to be a pretty big issue. 

In response to the initial revelation, McDonald’s came up with a half baked patch which still left some loopholes uncovered. Fallible has since informed McDonald’s of the same and is said to be awaiting a response. 

It is believed that this only affects the South & West division of McDonald’s as it uses a different app compared to the North & East division. Since the leak was only found in the South & West division of McDonald’s (McDelivery app), it’s likely that the other division is unaffected by this vulnerability. 

The North & East division of McDelivery and the website are run by a different organization, which makes it pretty clear that the leak is only seen in the South & West division of the app. However, one can’t be too sure when it’s about something as sensitive as a data breach. 

If you’re a user of McDonald’s India, we suggest you change your password or disable your account altogether for the time being. If such an option is not present, it would help to contact McDonald’s India to take suggestions on the next course of action.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390817000039/0000063908-17-000039-index.htm,Risk Factors,2017-08-08 00:00:00,"Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may interrupt our operations.
We are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, technologies supporting McDonald’s delivery and digital solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions.
Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. The third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business, including the credit risk of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations.

be required to notify. Once we have finalized our investigation of this error, if the determination
is made that there were any additional Maryland residents impacted, we will again reach out and
provide you with the additional count of residents.

The security and privacy of your personal information is of utmost importance to CenturyLink and we
take significant measures to protect it. Unfortunately, we recently discovered that an employee’s email
account was compromised which may have inadvertently exposed some of your personal information.
It is important to note that there is no evidence of misuse of the information or that the compromising
activity was designed for the purpose of capturing such information. Nonetheless, it is important to
notify you of this incident so that you are aware of the situation and can monitor your accounts.
WHAT HAPPENED?
On February 1, 2017, Corporate Security detected and began an investigation into a potentially
compromised email account that was being used to generate SPAM. As part of the investigation, we
determined that the compromise could have occurred as early as January 30, 2017 when an employee
provided account credentials in response to a phishing attack. While there is no indication that the
phishing attack was designed for anything other than to compromise an email account in order to send
SPAM, the method used may have allowed remote access to the employee’s emails which included
sensitive personally identifiable information.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?
The information potentially exposed varied by individual but could have included, among other things:
 Your name and address
 Your Social Security Number
 Your date of birth
The information did not include credit card or other banking information.
WHAT WE ARE DOING:
Within a short time of the security alert, the SPAM was stopped and several actions were taken to
prevent any further potential unauthorized access. We are also providing additional training and
examining procedures to minimize the risk of reoccurrence.
While we do not have any evidence that your sensitive, personal information has been misused, we do
want you to be aware of the situation so you can monitor your accounts. 
To support you, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership in Experian’s® ProtectMyID®
Alert. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with
identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. For
additional details about ProtectMyID, please see the last page of this letter. ProtectMyID is completely
free to you and enrolling will not hurt your credit score. A credit card is not required to enroll.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892617000013/0000018926-17-000013-index.htm,Risk Factors,2017-02-23 00:00:00,"We could be harmed by security breaches, damages or other significant disruptions or failures of our networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems, or of those we operate for certain of our customers.
We are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing and provisioning systems) to provide products and services to our customers and to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. As a communications company that transmits large amounts of information over communications networks, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our public networks or information technology infrastructure and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our business customers (which includes our wholesale and governmental customers) could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing sensitive and confidential customer data, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers’ proprietary information on our public networks or internal systems or the systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers.
We strive to maintain the security and integrity of information and systems under our control, and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, or could result from aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other systems to deliver services to our customers.
Similar to other large telecommunications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees. Although some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, to date, none of these breaches have resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume that we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks. Any such future security breaches or disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, especially in light of the growing frequency, scope and well-documented sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions.
Although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.
Additional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include:
•
power losses or physical damage, whether caused by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;
•
capacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in our customer's usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between our newer and older systems;
•
theft or failure of our equipment;
•
software or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;
•
deficiencies in our processes or controls;
•
our inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills to adequately maintain our systems;
•
programming, processing and other human error; and
•
service failures of our third-party vendors and other disruptions that are beyond our control.

22

Due to these factors, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service, and could experience more significant disruptions in the future.
Disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:
•
disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt (i) our operational or administrative functions or (ii) the operations of certain of our customers who rely upon us to provide services critical to their operations;
•
result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our customers’ end users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•
require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems;
•
require us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;
•
require us to provide credits for future service under certain service level commitments we have provided contractually to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers;
•
subject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies under our customer contracts or service standards set by state regulatory commissions, which in certain cases could exceed our insurance coverage; or

February 3, 2017

California residents please click here

IHG values the relationship we have with our guests and understands the importance of protecting payment card data.  On Dec. 28, 2016, IHG reported it was conducting an investigation after receiving a report of unauthorized charges occurring on some payment cards that were used at a small number of U.S. hotel properties.  IHG hired leading cyber security firms to examine the payment card processing systems for the hotels that it manages in the Americas region. Based on the investigation, IHG is providing notification to guests who used their payment card at restaurants and bars of 12 company managed properties during the time periods from August 2016 – December 2016 identified below.  An investigation of other properties in the Americas region is ongoing.  

Findings show that malware was installed on servers that processed payment cards used at restaurants and bars of 12 IHG managed properties.  Cards used at the front desk of these properties were not affected.  The malware searched for track data (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected server.   

A list of the affected restaurants and bars, along with the specific time frames for each (times vary by location), is as follows:

It is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.  Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take to protect your information.

We have been working with the security firms to review our security measures, confirm that this issue has been remediated, and evaluate ways to enhance our security measures.  We have also notified law enforcement and are working with the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards can be made aware and initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards. 

We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.  If you have questions, please call 855-656-6586 from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET, Monday to Friday.

What Happened? On December 12, 2016, several Axis employees received a spam phishing email to their
Axis email accounts. One Axis employee clicked on the link in the phishing email and entered her email
credentials. That same day, this Axis employee’s email account was used to send a similar phishing email
to all of the individuals in the employee’s contact list. Axis learned of this incident on December 12, 2016
and immediately initiated an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, into the
nature and scope of the event. As part of this investigation, we recently determined that this employee’s
email account contained some of your company’s information.
What Information Was Affected? The affected email account contained a copy of a business check, which
contained your name, bank account number, and bank routing number.
What We Are Doing. We take this incident and the security of your company’s information very seriously.
In addition to hiring a third-party forensic expert to assist in our investigation, we took steps to prevent
further misuse of this employee’s credentials and confirm the security of both her workstation and our

our systems to ensure the privacy and security of your company’s information. In addition to providing

Marin Software, an online ad management platform, suffered a data breach that may have compromised the personal information of many staffers and ex-staffers. The company alerted employees and former employees that their personal data, including W-2, Social Security number, address, email, salary and date of birth, was swiped by someone posing as a company executive. One former employee forwarded AdExchanger a copy of the notice, which was confirmed by Marin. Speaking with AdExchanger, a company rep said no customers were affected since the compromised personal info came from ADP payroll records and not from Marin’s marketing platform. The company is providing affected employees and ex-employees with a year-long subscription to LifeLock, an identity theft prevention service.

No ValueClick

It was a disappointing year for Epsilon, Alliance Data Services CFO Charles Horn said during the company’s full-year 2016 earnings call. Revenue increased just 1%, and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%. The culprits? Besides negative growth of its tech platform, Horn said “the old ValueClick business [which became Conversant, prior to its acquisition by Alliance] was a consistent issue all year as we endeavor to pivot it toward more of a data-driven solution.” He called it a “three-point drag on Epsilon’s revenue growth.” Read the earnings release and a transcript of the call.

Go Long

Facebook made a slight but important change to how it ranks videos in the news feed. The issue is that Facebook used “percent completion” as a key part of its proxy for user engagement (a commonsensical starting point). Except that position overattributes value to short videos. Watching half of an eight-minute segment may be a stronger indicator of quality than completing an eight-second vid. “As we continue to understand how our community consumes video, we’ve realized that we should therefore weight percent completion more heavily the longer a video is, to avoid penalizing longer videos,” per a Facebook blog post.

Plugged In

The changing of the guard in Washington, DC, has flipped the levers of power from digital-native platforms (like Google, Facebook and Amazon) to cable and ISP giants (like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T). AT&T’s stock is up more than 10% since the election and now faces a sympathetic FCC chairman for its proposed $85 billion Time Warner takeover [AdExchanger coverage]. Comcast crushed its earnings report Thursday, boosting shares to 20% higher than Election Day. And Verizon is reportedly making overtures in pursuit of a tie-up with the cable firm Charter – a potential monster merger with a strong chance of passing regulatory muster.

Online Shopping

EBay has “managed to right the ship” since it spun out PayPal in 2015 as part of an effort to refocus as an internet retailer, but its growth numbers “just aren't aggressive enough to match eBay's grand ambitions to take on internet retailing behemoth Amazon.com Inc.,” writes Shelly Banjo at Bloomberg.

UGI Utilities said Thursday that the personal information of about 1,900 employees and former employees was ""acquired"" by the perpetrators of an email phishing scheme that targeted the company Tuesday.

UGI said its customer information systems were not breached and no customer information was exposed. The fraud affected employees who worked for the company in 2016. They are being notified and are being provided with assistance, the company said in a news release.

It did not release many details, including the nature of the phishing email and what type of personal information was stolen. But this sounds similar to a scheme the IRS warned about this week and that I wrote about in my column on Thursday.

That information can be used to commit all sorts of identity theft, including tax identity theft. That fraud occurs when a crook files a tax return under someone else's name and Social Security number, often using made-up information, to qualify themselves for a refund.

The scam targeted businesses last year, and the IRS warned this week that it's going around again. UGI isn't alone in being hit. I've written about this happening before.

Last year, Main Line Health in suburban Philadelphia said an employee was duped into sending the personal information of the health system's staff to someone who had emailed requesting the data. Snapchat, a video messaging company, also suffered a similar data breach last year when a scammer impersonated the company's CEO and emailed an employee to ask for payroll information.

The misleading emails don't always stand out as a scam because they often contain the actual name of a chief executive officer. In some cases, the messages come from the executive's true email account that has been compromised, the Internet Crime Complaint Center says.

The IRS said the scam emails make requests such as:

•""Kindly send me the individual 2016 W-2 (PDF) and earnings summary of all W-2 of our company staff for a quick review.""

•""Can you send me the updated list of employees with full details (Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Home Address, Salary).""

•""I want you to send me the list of W-2 copy of employees wage and tax statement for 2016, I need them in PDF file type, you can send it as an attachment. Kindly prepare the lists and email them to me asap.""

Businesses should be on the lookout for these types of phishing scams. They should train their workers, especially those with access to payroll information, to investigate all requests for employee records. Check email addresses closely, and verify with the CEO or requester that they actually asked for the documents.

While some workers might not want to bother a busy executive, I'm sure the top dog would rather take the time to answer a question than clean up the mess created by a data breach.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,46.29999923706055,48.16999816894531,49.97000122070313,49.65999984741211,50.95000076293945,49.68000030517578,50.68000030517578,49.38999938964844,47.68000030517578,47.66999816894531,47.45000076293945,46.47999954223633,47.54999923706055,45.0,46.6

Potomac Healthcare Solutions, a subcontractor brought on board to supply healthcare professionals to the US government and military organizations through its Washington, DC.-based contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, was the source of the data leak.

Chris Vickery, lead security researcher of the MacKeeper Security Center, who found the data, told ZDNet in an email that Potomac's own insecure server was the source of the leak.

Samples of the leaked data provided by Vickery and also reviewed by ZDNet revealed that the personal data of US military personnel was open for all eyes to see, with little in the way to prevent it from being abused.

Many of the victims involved in the data leak are part of the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which includes those both formerly employed by US military branches, such as the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and those presumably still on active deployment.

The bulk of the data is made up of military personnel files and lists of physical and mental health support staff, including nurses, doctors, and mental health professionals.

Names, contract types, Social Security numbers, and duty start dates -- dating back to 1998 -- as well as billet numbers that detail the living quarters for when staff are not on active duty, are all included in the information leak.

Unit assignments and places of work, which include military bases and their postings worldwide, were also in the documents.

Many of those named in the leaked personnel files are linked to SOCOM's Preservation of the Force and Families (POTFF) program, a scheme that aims to ease the psychological and physical burdens often placed on military personnel and their families through unit-specific teams of healthcare professionals and counsellors.

The files include names of social workers, physical therapists, nurses and assistants, doctors, and psychologists, which alongside detail the states of their residency, pay scales, contract start and term dates, units and work locations.

The documents supplied by Vickery also revealed a ""master tracking list"" of POTFF personnel personal data and their security clearance levels.

Some of those possess ""top secret"" clearance, including access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) -- typically only granted to vetted staff who are then hired to work on sensitive special access programs.

The list also revealed the name and location of one special forces data analyst, who was awarded top-tier clearance.

The master tracking list also exposed recruitment notes on candidates. One such note described how a senior US military officer had ""doubts"" that an applicant would ""ever be granted security clearance"" in part because the applicant ""only has dual citizenship due to being born to US military.""

Access to that level of information would be highly sought-after by a foreign power, which could use the information to target the military member for conducting espionage.

Vickery described the incident and its potential implications in a blog post.

""It's not hard to imagine a Hollywood plotline in which a situation like this results in someone being kidnapped or blackmailed for information. Let's hope that I was the only outsider to come across this gem. Let's really hope that no hostile entities found it,"" he said.

""Loose backups sink ships,"" he added, highlighting how severe the consequences could be for military agencies.

Vickery's discovery, however, was not as the result of any complicated heist, malware infection, or attack on the researcher's part.

Rather, it was the subcontractor's own insecure server and use of ""rsync,"" a common protocol used for synchronizing copies of files between two different computers, which weren't protected with a username or password.

Vickery said he believes the security failure could be down to a backup device of some kind which was misconfigured. He said that at least 11 gigabytes of data was exposed by the leaky system, but he added that he was not certain just how much sensitive information in total was available for the taking.

Potomac since secured the data after Vickery told it of the leak.

Despite sending numerous emails Tom Burden, co-chief executive of Potomac, the company hasn't contacted the researcher since.

The consequences of the leak could be severe -- not just for the healthcare personnel provider but the victims of information disclosure themselves.

This kind of data can be used in all manner of identity theft schemes and added to the release of security clearance levels to public eyes, staffers may have been placed at serious risk.

When reached, Burden said in an email that the company did ""acknowledge"" Vickery's email, adding that the company was ""addressing"" the incident.

Booz Allen, the contractor that brought on Potomac, told ZDNet in an email that it was ""looking into"" the incident. ""We take any allegation of a data breach very seriously, including those from our subcontractors,"" said a spokesperson.

(Booz Allen, too, has seen its fair share of leaks in the not-so-distant past. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified files to journalists while working for the Pentagon contractor in 2013. Recently, a second employee Harold Martin was arrested and charged with espionage for stealing terabytes of data from the NSA during two decades of employment.)

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Dept. for Defense did not respond to a request for comment at the time of writing.

The realization that US military files have been left for all to see could make those in the forces who need help but do not want it to become public knowledge reluctant to seek assistance in the fear that the next military data breach will include their own case details.

As bad, given the job roles of individuals in the leak, it's hardly difficult to imagine the files being used as an avenue to find, contact, blackmail and coerce military healthcare professionals into giving over insider information on the US military and employees.

Today's terrorist activities and nation-state adversaries mean it's trivial for data leaks to be utilized to personally target military personnel and their families.

Update: Potomac told ZDNet:

""We are aware of the report from an independent security researcher alleging an unauthorized exposure of sensitive government information. Upon learning of the allegation, we immediately initiated an internal review and brought in an external forensic IT firm for additional support. While our investigation remains ongoing, based on our initial examination, despite these earlier reports, we have no indication that any sensitive government information was compromised. The privacy and security of information remains a top priority, and we will continue to work diligently to address any issues or concerns.""", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,35.720001220703125,34.470001220703125,36.20000076293945,35.080001831054695,35.58000183105469,39.22000122070313,32.549999237060554,34.02000045776367,34.65999984741211,37.68999862670898,37.810001373291016,38.54999923706055,37.959999084472656,39.5,39.5

Ameriprise Financial has a fresh data breach mystery on their hands. Around December 5th, I discovered Social Security numbers, bank authorization details, confidential internal company documentation, decryption keys, and certificates all alongside approximately 350 client directories (representing millions of invested dollars).

Here’s what we know:  The data was coming from a Network Attached Storage device insecurely configured with no username or password required for access. This specific leaky device was not on the internal Ameriprise network, as it was physically located inside an Ameriprise employee’s home. But then how did it receive and store unencrypted, internal Ameriprise data? That’s the mystery.
It turns out that an identical NAS device exists within this employee’s satellite Ameriprise office, and somehow the devices were synchronizing with each other over the open internet. I found it through a random review of Shodan.io rsync results.

Out of an abundance of caution, Ameriprise has pulled both devices and will be examining them within an internal IT lab.
Through journalist Zack Whittaker, of CNET/ZDNET/CBS, I’ve heard that Ameriprise is claiming the company does not supply these devices to their offices. This may be at odds with what I was told by the affected financial advisor in question. I was informed that the very reason he had one of the devices in his house was because it is the same exact model of device they use at his office.
Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Ameriprise specifically deployed or even authorized the use of that device within the advisor’s office. However, an Ameriprise employee did indicate to me that the pulling and examining of the devices was, in part, to make sure there wasn’t a bigger problem to worry about. To me, that says there is at least some concern that more of these devices may be out in Ameriprise offices. That’s not to say there’s any reason to think more may be misconfigured in the same way, but it’s at least worth looking into as a possibility.
When Zack Wittaker asked how Ameriprise secures NAS devices that its offices may be using, Ameriprise’s PR people replied, “We provide a secure online storage solution for this information.”
I find it odd, then, that within the leaked data there is a confidential Business Continuity Plan (BCP), dated Feb. 4th, 2015, in which Ameriprise asks its advisors “Do you keep your backup computer records (i.e. hard drive, memory stick, etc.) at a location other than your office?”, to which the possible answers are “Yes”, “No”, and “N/A – (select this option if you are using an online solution)”.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,112.93000030517578,115.2699966430664,127.80999755859376,132.41000366210938,126.2300033569336,128.77000427246094,127.83000183105469,134.74000549316406,145.13999938964844,139.00999450683594,152.91000366210938,157.11000061035156,165.4499969482422,65.5,71.4875

The restaurant chain told the Mirror only around 30 members had been targeted but that all customers had been informed.

It is understood no financial details have been compromised but that personal information including names, addresses, e-mail addresses may have been hacked.

As part of Cisco’s commitment to trust and transparency, we are writing to inform you about an incident
potentially involving your personal information.
An independent security researcher discovered that a limited set of job application related information from
the Cisco Professional Careers mobile website was accessible. Cisco’s investigation found this to be the
result of an incorrect security setting following system maintenance. The issue was immediately fixed and
passwords to the site have been disabled. Because Cisco takes its responsibility to protect information
seriously, and since many people use the same passwords on multiple websites, we wanted to alert you to
this incident.
As a precaution, users of Cisco’s Professional Careers Website will need to reset their passwords at their
next login by clicking “forgot my password”.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOVLED
Exposed data included the following data fields: name, address, email, phone number, username and password,
answers to security questions, education and professional profile, cover letter and resume text, and
voluntary information (if entered) such as gender, race, veteran status, and disability.
Our investigation discovered that the incorrect settings were in place from August 2015 to September
2015, and again from July 2016 to August 2016. We do not believe that the information was accessed by
anyone beyond the researcher who found and reported the issue. However, there was an instance of unexplained,
anomalous connection to the server during that time, so we are taking precautionary steps.
WHAT WE ARE DOING
We take data protection and transparency very seriously. We continue to investigate the incident and are
putting additional protocols in place to help prevent such an incident in the future.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
We recommend that you update/change your login credentials, password and security questions / answers
for any other websites that use the same credentials and information as the Cisco Professional Careers
mobile website.
Additional Options:
Obtain More Information to Protect Yourself
Visit any of the three US Credit Bureau websites for general information regarding protecting your
identity. And the Federal Trade Commission has an identity theft hotline: 877-438-4338; TTY: 1-866-
653-4261. They also provide information on-line at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.
Place a 90-Day Fraud Alert on Your Credit file
An initial 90 day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are
a victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase
the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should
take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request
should not be satisfied. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not
open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have
questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.
Manage your personal information
Take steps such as: carrying only essential documents with you; being aware of whom you are sharing
your personal information with and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.
Use Tools from Credit Providers
Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card and other account statements. Be proactive

The company’s e-commerce site was intercepting payment details for website visitors that made purchases between Sept. 2 and Oct. 12 of this year.

Security researcher Troy Hunt broke the news, posting a tweet showing the letter that the company sent customers.

“We were recently made aware that www.converse.com.au was targeted by computer hackers using malicious programs known as malware,” the letter reads. “This malware targeted payment card information.”

The site is actually run by a company called Conquest Sports, which licenses the Converse name in Australia and New Zealand. So, other sites elsewhere in the world remain unaffected.

The good news is that Conquest Sports was able to catch the intrusion quickly—once discovered on Oct. 12, it remediated the issue the same day, it said.

The news comes just as Australia reels from its largest-ever data breach, stemming from an attack on the Australian Red Cross Blood Service.

The data stolen in that attack included over 1.2 million records pertaining to 550,000 blood donor applicants. The information crucially included answers to a highly sensitive question on whether the applicant had engaged in ""at-risk"" sexual behavior over the past year.

Other info included names, blood types, dates of birth, email and snail mail addresses and phone numbers—all of which could be used in subsequent phishing attacks.

On September 15, 2016, Vera Bradley was provided information from law enforcement regarding a potential data security issue related to our retail store network. Upon learning this information, we immediately notified the payment card networks and initiated an investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm to aggressively gather facts and determine the scope of the issue.

Payment cards used at Vera Bradley retail store locations between July 25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may have been affected. Not all cards used during this time frame were affected. Cards used on our website have not been affected.

Findings from the investigation show unauthorized access to Vera Bradley's payment processing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data. The program was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code - as the data was being routed through the affected payment systems. There is no indication that other customer information was at risk.

It is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner. The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card. Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take to protect your information.

Vera Bradley has stopped this incident, and we continue to work with the computer security firm to further strengthen the security of our systems to help prevent this from happening again.

Vera Bradley values the relationship we have with our customers and understands the importance of protecting personal information. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

We have resolved this incident and continue to work with the computer security firm to further strengthen the security of our systems to help prevent this from happening in the future. We continue to support law enforcement’s investigation and also promptly notified the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards could initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards.
Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded an immaterial amount of expense relating to the Payment Card Incident. Expenses included costs to investigate the Payment Card Incident and obtain legal and other professional services.
Future Costs
We expect to incur additional legal and professional services, as well as expenses and capital investments for remediation activities associated with the Payment Card Incident and will recognize the expenses as incurred. In addition, payment card companies and associations may require us to reimburse them for unauthorized card charges and costs to replace cards and may also impose fines or penalties in connection with the Payment Card Incident, and enforcement authorities may also impose fines or other remedies against us. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss related to any fines or penalties that may be assessed, if any. The Payment Card Incident, including customer response and any possible third party claims or assessments from payment card companies, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We expect our insurance coverage will offset most of the expenses for the investigation and other non-remediation legal and professional services associated with the incident, possible third party claims, as well as fines, penalties, or other expenses, if any, imposed by payment card companies, as discussed above.
Insurance Coverage
We maintained $15.0 million of cyber security insurance coverage above a $0.1 million deductible.",0,,15000000,,,,,14.539999961853027,14.720000267028807,12.31999969482422,11.8100004196167,10.8100004196167,9.399999618530273,9.010000228881836,8.609999656677246,8.920000076293945,9.09000015258789,10.020000457763672,8.420000076293945,8.020000457763674,,

After investigative reporter Brian Krebs reported a compromise of Oracle&#039;s ORCL +0.17% MICROS unit earlier this week, it now appears the same allegedly Russian cybercrime gang has hit five others in the last month: Cin7, ECRS, Navy Zebra, PAR Technology and Uniwell. Together, they supply as many as, if not more than, 1 million point-of-sale systems globally.

The hackers’ normal modus operandi was simple: first find weaknesses in point-of-sale (PoS) system vendors’ servers and hack them. (PoS systems, whether cash registers or otherwise, store and process customers’ credit card data). From there, they attempted to steal passwords of retail customers either during or after they logged in. They could then try to gain remote access into the retailers’ PoS computer, which would likely hold troves of shoppers’ credit-card information.

So far, however, it’s unclear what, if any, sensitive data was pilfered from the vendors. Nevertheless, that one group has managed to infiltrate a string of PoS providers in recent months may help explain a spate of attacks on retail and hotel chains. In the last year, significant breaches have hit Donald Trump’s hotel group, Hyatt, Kimpton and 1,000 Wendy’s restaurants, amongst others.

‘Wave of mass exploitation’

The revelations of the latest breaches came from Alex Holden, CISO and founder of Hold Security, a cybercrime monitoring firm. Holden passed FORBES information he’d acquired from the hackers behind the breaches, who’d claimed control over servers belonging to the PoS vendors, including the Oracle property. In some cases, the hacker showed off usernames and passwords to backdoors on the servers as evidence.

When FORBES contacted the five victims, four confirmed they’d been hacked to differing degrees of severity. One said it was investigating. Oracle confirmed its breach earlier this week, claiming legacy systems were affected and telling all MICROS customers to change their passwords.

A spokesperson from ECRS, which claims thousands of customers across the U.S., confirmed a data breach occurred within myECRS, used by customers to review product documentation, download software and get technical support. “ECRS was able to confirm that an unknown entity was able to place malicious code on this web portal. Evidence indicates that the attacker exploited a very recently discovered vulnerability in the third-party web server software that powers this portal to place this code,” a spokesperson said. FORBES believes the affected site ran on an Apache web server, though there’s no indication what vulnerability was exploited.

The company said no software distributed from the portal had been modified by the attacker; the hackers could have caused havoc if they’d managed to spread malware further inside tainted downloads. “Furthermore, the affected system was segregated from the systems that ECRS uses to facilitate remote access to merchant systems, and the affected system was not used to store sensitive information pertaining to credit card processing,” the spokesperson added.

They admitted it was possible, though not confirmed, that contact information, including business addresses, telephone numbers, names and email addresses of current and former employees, vendors, affiliates and clients of ECRS, were stolen by the attacker. Customers were advised to be cautious if contacted by people claiming to come from ECRS, as it may be the hackers hoping to scam merchants or trick them into handing over more information.

The company said it has contacted law enforcement, has removed the malware and will be releasing a new version of the portal tomorrow. It will be enforcing a password change for all merchants using myECRS.

Cin7, a young UK-based supplier that claims to have hundreds of paying customers in 51 countries including the US, confirmed malicious code was running on one of its servers. Company founder Danny Ing said the malware had now been removed.

“The malicious code was designed to get passwords from the database or operating system. We are currently investigating the extent of the breach and we will inform customers if required,” Ing told FORBES.

“On the surface there does not seem to be any damage or loss of data. Our team will investigate further… this is an extremely serious issue and we are now determining the appropriate response.”

Navy Zebra, a subsidiary of Bankcard Services, confirmed it was looking into the claims, but has yet to provide a formal response on its findings. A spokesperson said the company didn’t store any “private data”. It supplies to 26,000 businesses in the U.S. The hacker had provided evidence of two separate backdoors on Navy Zebra servers.

PAR Technology Corporation, probably the biggest of those targeted and a publicly listed company, said the hacked server was non-material and didn’t include any production data. “We’re looking at it as a non-material event. We deal with this stuff all the time, people looking at getting backdoors,” said Kevin Jaskolka, PARTech’s vice president of marketing. “We feel very good about our security standards.”

PARTech created the industry’s first standalone PoS terminal for McDonald’s in 1978. Recently-announced customers include Lenny’s Subs, restaurant chain Five Guys and Ireland’s biggest pub organization, The Louis Fitzgerald Group. In July, it announced $52.7 million in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Uniwell president Steve Mori said the hacked only contained “public domain” information, such as product manuals, installation documents and brochures. Nothing confidential was stolen he said, but noted login credentials had to be changed. “Moving forward, our plan is to shut down our uniwell-americas.com web server as we believe it will remain vulnerable. We will use other secure services to facilitate our customers accessing manuals and documentation,” Mori added.

Uniwell claims to have more than 500,000 point-of-sale terminals in use worldwide. The other firms have not revealed how many point-of-sale systems they have deployed. As MICROS served 330,000 different businesses, it’s likely the breached companies supply well over 1 million computerized cash registers in total. There is, therefore, understandable concern over the hackers’ widespread access, possibly deep into America’s retail industry.

“There is definitely a high level of interest in PoS providers as gateways into retailers. In many cases, hackers seem to be interested in support information with a goal to get into remote systems as the highest authorized user,” said Holden.

“This is a new wave of mass exploitation.”

Who is behind the hacks?

According to Krebs, sources indicated the Carbanak gang, also known as Anunak, was linked to the Oracle breach, as the hackers had used a server operated by the crew. To be clear, though, Carbanak is the name given by security researchers to a collection of malware, one originally thought to be operated by a single group, widely believed to be Russian and responsible for as much as $1 billion in theft.

But the Carbanak malware, FORBES understands, is used by more than one cybercrime gang. According to Peter Kruse, founder of the CSIS Security Group, at least one hacker crew has combined Carbanak with another infamous malware, Dridex. The latter would be used across targets, with the Carbanak tools used for deeper penetration of targets of interest, he told FORBES.

“We have seen [Carbanak] dropped as a second stage payload to a random Dridex infection,” Kruse said. “So it appears that at least one of the groups use Dridex as an initial infector, and then use that to pinpoint infections of interest… Clever to hide in mass infections and then using more advanced and targeted malware against those of interest.”

Holden believes a Russian hacker is breaking into retail suppliers before selling the access on, in recent cases through English-speaking individuals. In the case of Navy Zebra, the English-speaking hacker claimed to have already sold access to the company’s server. According to Holden, the same hackers have been operating botnets and selling credit card dumps in recent years. It was only recently they started targeting PoS providers. He is unsure if they are all part of the Carbanak gang.

FORBES was previously told hackers using Carbanak tools were responsible for a 2014 hack of office supplier Staples, nabbing data on 1.16 million credit cards. Retailers Sheplers and Bebe were also said to have been hit.

For five months of last year, Carbanak disappeared, only to return in earnest this year. The group had started targeting a wider range or organizations, including businesses’ budgeting and accounting departments, according to a Kaspersky Lab analysis. In one particularly outlandish hack, the gang changed the name of one victim company’s ownership records, so that a money mule became a firm’s executive.

Whoever is using Carbanak now is causing a significant amount of damage to US retail companies. And they’re likely pilfering a large number of Americans’ credit card data to boot.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,5.190000057220459,5.0900001525878915,5.300000190734863,5.400000095367432,5.309999942779541,5.579999923706055,6.510000228881836,6.519999980926514,7.320000171661378,8.350000381469728,8.479999542236326,8.670000076293945,9.329999923706056,,

Oracle has suffered a data breach within its retail unit.

The cloud giant discovered malicious software on systems running its network of MICROS payment terminals, the company confirmed in an email to Fortune. In addition to affecting hundreds of the company’s computers, the breach affects an online support portal that allows Oracle to remotely address customers’ issues concerning their cash register-connected terminals, Brian Krebs, an independent cybersecurity journalist, first reported on his site Krebs on Security on Monday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The malware planted on Oracle’s systems enabled attackers to steal customers’ login credentials, Krebs noted. In response, Oracle said it is forcing users of the service to change their account passwords, adding that the breach does not affect its other corporate networks, cloud services, and systems.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

The MICROS system compromise could explain why so many shops, hotels, and retail outlets have been suffered breaches at their point of sale systems in the past months, said Avivah Litan, an analyst in Gartner  IT -0.85% . Asked whether she believed that this breach has something to do with a recent spate of stolen payment card data in retail and hotel hacks, Litan told Fortune, “I think it’s very likely.”

“If they’re MICROS customers, this would 100% explain that,” she said on a call.

MICROS point-of-sale technology, which Oracle  ORCL -0.07%  acquired for $5.3 billion in late 2014, is used by companies in hoteling: (Hyatt  H 0.02% , Marriott  MAR 0.23% , Hilton  HLT 0.00% , food and beverages: (Yum  YUM 0.21% , Starbucks  SBUX 0.14% , Burger King  BKW 0.00% , and retail: (Ikea  IKEA 0.00% , BJ’s  BJ 0.00% , Adidas  ADDYY 0.42% .

According to a 2014 Oracle power point presentation, MICROS is used by 330,00 sites across 180 countries. That would make it one of the three largest providers of point of sale tech worldwide, alongside Verifone  PAY 0.00%  and Ingenico  INGIY 0.23% .

For more on Oracle, watch:


Krebs cited the Carbanak Gang, a group of cybercriminals that security experts have said stole more than $1 billion from financial firms and others in recent years, as a possible perpetrator of the attack. One of the group’s computer servers was found to be in contact with the malware, unnamed sources told him.

Per Krebs:

The size and scope of the break-in is still being investigated, and it remains unclear when the attackers first gained access to Oracle’s systems.” Sources close to the investigation say Oracle first considered the breach to be limited to a small number of computers and servers at the company’s retail division. That source said that soon after Oracle pushed new security tools to systems in the affected network investigators realized the intrusion impacted more than 700 infected systems.
Here is the note from Oracle concerning the breach, obtained by Fortune, in full:
Dear MICROS Customer,
Oracle Security has detected and addressed malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems. Oracle’s Corporate network and Oracle’s other cloud and service offerings were not impacted by this code. Payment card data is encrypted both at rest and in transit in the MICROS hosted environment.
To prevent a recurrence, Oracle implemented additional security measures for the legacy MICROS systems. Consistent with standard security remediation protocols, Oracle is requiring MICROS customers to change the passwords for all MICROS accounts. Information for customers on how to change your passwords has been published on My Oracle Support (Doc ID 2165744.1). We also recommend that you change the password for any account that was used by a MICROS representative to access your on-premises systems.

hacker claims amazon failed to secure kindle users info 0x2Taylor
In a Twitter direct message, hacker @0x2Taylor told Mic that he and a buddy “’breached a server’ owned by Amazon that contained database files with more than 80,000 Kindle users’ information.”

The data included names, addresses, passwords, user agents, IP addresses and more. He claimed, “When they first got Kindles and set them up, all their stuff was being logged and put into a database.” 0x2Taylor sent Mic emails and passwords to try to “legitimize the breach.”

0x2Taylor claims to have informed Amazon; he posted a screenshot to prove he had the data and attempted to extort $700 from Amazon in exchange for not disclosing the breach “because the attack was easy.” He allegedly hoped this would push Amazon into implementing better secure measures.

Although he “personally” didn’t want to leak the data, he said, “If I don't receive a payment from them the data will be posted online along with an older dump.”

Amazon reportedly ignored his warning, so he uploaded the data to Mega cloud storage and tweeted a link to the leak.

He called Amazon “a big company and they should have enough money to have the proper security defenses.” He added, “I was trying to prove [to] them privately but they were ignoring my warnings.”

Tony Gambacorta, vice president of operations at cybersecurity firm Synack, told Mic that the data seems to be legit.

Looking through the leaked information, Gambacorta said he was “definitely” able to see phone numbers, street addresses, email addresses, the last time a user logged in (7:33 p.m. on June 5th of this year, meaning this isn't old data), how many times that user tried to log in, how many times he successfully logged in and his login source IP address.

Yet Gambacorta called it more of a privacy issue than a security issue, since it seems likely the passwords were “auto-assigned by a system.” He added, “I wouldn’t want to find my name on this list.”

Dumped data for actual Kindle users or not?

I checked out the data, too, choosing five names at random. Google Maps placed three of the addresses in locations without houses, such as in the middle of the woods or half way between two houses down a country road.

As for phone numbers for those five people, none of the calls connected. Three gave an error message about the “number or code you dialed is incorrect,” one had a weird fast busy signal, and the fifth resulted in “the person you called is unavailable right now.”

All of the email addresses seem to be in a weird format, such as johndoe6lak5m5@hotmail.com, johndoevmv69ok@gmail.com, johndoe21m5rac@yahoo.com. For each of the five names, the corresponding passwords were way too random, too secure, ranging from 8 to 11 capital letters mixed with numbers. Of course, that was testing only five of the reportedly 83,899 individuals included in the data dump.

Brian Wallace, aka @botnet_hunter, is a security researcher and member of the Cylance SPEAR team. He examined the Amazon data and found quite a few problems. He believes “the data does not belong to legitimate users and there is no need for concern to Amazon users.” The data has been generated, Wallace said, but he is not sure if it is “fake data or bot accounts.”

Wallace told Security Affairs that the 83,899 email addresses “only resided on Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail” and the passwords were “random upper case letters and numbers, with no words and no occurrences of popular passwords.”

He added that the user agents also “did not represent legitimate user behavior” and appear to have been “picked from a short list at random.” A large amount of the “last IP” addresses belong to ColoCrossing, and at least some of the users would not have connected from a data center.

In other words, don’t sweat it. Wallace concluded:

Based on this evidence, I believe the data released is not representative of actual Amazon users, but instead this information was generated. It is not clear whether this information was generated by the individual who released the information, or if it was generated by a third party, and that information was then obtained by the individual who released it.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872416000324/0001018724-16-000324-index.htm,Risk Factors,2016-10-28 00:00:00,"We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS Global) is a leading provider of technology for the financial services industry. According to its website, FIS, a Fortune 500 company, serves more than 20,000 clients in over 130 countries and employs more than 55,000 people worldwide. 

How many it employs in information security is not clear, but it might want to add a few more in light of a breach involving client information it allegedly suffered last week—one the firm was allegedly warned about but never publicly acknowledged.

A vulnerability in client portal?
The hacker, 1x0123, identifies himself as an “underground researcher.” According to statements previously made to the Daily Dot and other media outlets, he forgoes bug bounty programs but is generally seeking money—either from the vulnerable firm or from those who would buy information about the vulnerability to exploit for their own purposes. Last month, 1x0123 claimed to have hacked Pornhub and to have sold the information to three others before Pornhub patched the vulnerability. Pornhub denied that it had been hacked.

Last week, 1x0123 claimed to have accessed FIS Global’s client portal. He posted one unredacted screenshot from a Client Contacts screen and one screenshot from Client Invoices with billings to Guaranty Bank and Trust Company. Both screenshots have been redacted by the Daily Dot to shield employees’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, and account numbers:

In private messages, 1x0123, who indicates that English is not his first language, informed the Daily Dot that “the vulnerability exists in the login portal wich (sic) allows anyone to reset passwords without knowing the old password.. i shared 2 screenshots and they reported my [Twitter] account and got me [to] delete those.” 

1x0123 also provided the Daily Dot with other screenshots. One showed that he had been able to successfully reset the password of a named employee of Guaranty Bank and Trust Company. A LinkedIn search revealed that the named employee is a vice president of the bank. The Daily Dot called her to notify her of the compromise of her login and of the exposure of her bank’s data, but she did not return the call. Nor did the head of the bank’s cybersecurity department return a call from the Daily Dot to alert them that its data had been exposed on the Internet and more could be exposed.

The Daily Dot was also provided with an archive containing dozens of recent FIS invoices to Guaranty Bank and Trust Company for various services. Inspection of the invoices does not indicate that any customers’ personally identifiable information was included.

Of note, all of the screenshots and files provided to the Daily Dot involved Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, and only that one bank. Despite 1x0123’s claims that FIS’s client portal was vulnerable to password resetting, he either did not access or download data from other FIS clients, or he did not choose to share any other data with the Daily Dot.

1x0123 informs the Daily Dot that as of Tuesday night, the vulnerability was secured. But because he never received any response or acknowledgement from FIS, he stated that he intends to leak all the invoices he downloaded. Had FIS Global acknowledged his effort to alert it, he claims, he would not have taken that vindictive step.

Déjà vu all over again?
Last week’s incident was not FIS’s first breach. In 2011, it dutifully notified the Securities and Exchange Commission after hackers managed to raise or remove the daily withdrawal limits on 22 debit cards the hackers accessed from FIS’s prepaid card network. The cards were cloned and distributed to co-conspirators who, in a carefully timed attack, managed to withdraw $13 million from ATMs.


When FIS reported the incident to regulators and investors in May 2011, it indicated that the breach was limited in scope, putting approximately 7,000 cardholders’ non-public information at risk. But two years later, when the FDIC released an audit conducted in the months and year following the incident, FIS’s clients and the public learned that FIS’s security failures were much more serious than the company had realized or disclosed. As security journalist Brian Krebs reported in June 2013:

“‘The initial findings have identified many additional servers exposed by the attackers; and many more instances of the malware exploits utilized in the network intrusions of 2011, which were never properly identified or assessed,’ the FDIC examiners wrote in a report from October 2012. ‘As a result, FIS management now recognizes that the security breach events of 2011 were not just a pre-paid card fraud event, as originally maintained, but rather are that of a broader network intrusion.’”
In response to the breach and audit, FIS claimed to have invested $100 million in ramping up its security:

“Since that time, FIS has continued to strengthen its information security and risk position, including investments over two years of $100 million or more, as part of our goal to provide best-in-class information security and risk management to each of our 14,000-plus clients. We have openly and regularly communicated these initiatives, our progress and results to our clients and shareholders through meetings, monthly updates, quarterly public disclosures, Board materials, educational webinars, and more.”
But as Krebs noted,

“The FDIC found that even though FIS has hired a number of incident response firms and has spent more than $100 million responding to the 2011 breach, the company failed to enact some very basic security mechanisms. For example, the FDIC noted that FIS routinely uses blank or default passwords on numerous production systems and network devices, even though these were some of the same weaknesses that ‘contributed to the speed and ease with which attackers transgressed and exposed FIS systems during the 2011 network intrusion.’

“…. ‘The Executive Summary Scan reports from November 2012 show 18,747 network vulnerabilities and over 291 application vulnerabilities as past due,’ the report charges.”

FIS Global’s response
The Daily Dot contacted FIS Global to ask them about the claimed portal vulnerability, but they did not respond to email inquiries sent on Tuesday and Wednesday. Nor did its Twitter team respond to a request to follow so that the author could privately ask for a response or comment.  

It is not known whether FIS ever contacted its client or clients to alert them that their data had been downloaded and was being exposed online.

Hackers may have used malware to collect more than 32 million Twitter login credentials that are now being sold on the dark web. Twitter says that its systems have not been breached.

“We are confident that these usernames and credentials were not obtained by a Twitter data breach – our systems have not been breached. In fact, we’ve been working to help keep accounts protected by checking our data against what’s been shared from recent other password leaks,” a Twitter spokesperson said.
LeakedSource, a site with a search engine of leaked login credentials, said in a blog post that it received a copy of the user information from “Tessa88@exploit.im,” the same alias used by the person who gave it hacked data from Russian social network VK last week.

Other major security compromises which have hit the news recently include a Myspace hack that involved over 360 million accounts, possibly making it the largest one ever, and the leak of 100 million LinkedIn passwords stolen in 2012.

LeakedSource says the cache of Twitter data contains 32,888,300 records, including email addresses, usernames, and passwords. LeakedSource has added the information to its search engine, which is paid but lets people remove leaked information for free.

Based on information in the data (including the fact that many of the passwords are displayed in plaintext), LeakedSource believes that the user credentials were collected by malware infecting browsers like Firefox or Chrome rather than stolen directly from Twitter. Many of the affected users appear to be in Russia—six of the top 10 email domains represented in the database are Russian, including mail.ru and yandex.ru.

Even though Mark Zuckerberg got several of his non-Facebook social media accounts hacked this week, including Twitter, his information wasn’t included in this data set, LeakedSource claims. Zuckerberg was ridiculed for appearing to reuse “dadada” as his password on multiple sites, but results from LeakedSource’s data analysis shows that many people are much less creative. The most popular password, showing up 120,417 times, was “123456,” while “password” appears 17,471 times. An analysis of the VK data also turned up similar results.

In a statement to TechCrunch, Twitter suggested that the recent hijacking of accounts belonging to Zuckerberg and other celebrities was due to the re-use of passwords leaked in the LinkedIn and Myspace breaches.

“A number of other online services have seen millions of passwords stolen in the past several weeks. We recommend people use a unique, strong password for Twitter,” a Twitter spokesperson said. Twitter suggests that users follow the suggestions in its help center to keep their accounts secure. Twitter also posted on its @Support account that it is auditing its data against recent database dumps.

LeakedSource said that it determined the validity of the leaked data by asking 15 users to verify their passwords. All 15 confirmed that the passwords listed for their accounts were correct. However, experts cautioned that the data may not be legitimate.

Michael Coates, Twitter’s trust and information security officer, tweeted that he is confident the social media platform’s systems have not been compromised.

“We securely store all passwords w/ bcrypt,” Coates added, referencing a password hashing function considered secure. “We are working with LeakedSource to obtain this info & take additional steps to protect users,” he continued.

Troy Hunt, the creator of a site that catalogs breaches called haveibeenpwned.com, also expressed skepticism about the authenticity of the data. Hunt told TechCrunch that he’d heard rumors of breaches at Twitter and Facebook for several weeks but had yet to see convincing proof. “They may well be old leaks if they’re consistent with the other big ones we’ve seen and simply haven’t seen the light of day yet. Incidentally, the account takeovers we’ve seen to date are almost certainly as a result of credential reuse across other data breaches,” Hunt said.

Whether or not the leaked Twitter credentials are authentic, it never hurts to change your password — especially if you use the same password across several sites. Turning on two-factor authentication also helps keep your account secure, even if your password is leaked.

Update: This story has been updated with additional context about the leak and clarified to note that Twitter did not suffer a data breach.", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459016021918/0001564590-16-021918-index.htm,Risk Factors,2016-08-01 00:00:00,"If our security measures are breached, or if our products and services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and advertisers may curtail or stop using our products and services and our business and operating results could be harmed.
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and advertisers’ information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability.

We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, and as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our users’ or advertisers’ data.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, electric utility companies are part of the nation’s “critical infrastructure.”

UPDATE (Jun 1st): This post has been updated to include statement from PG&E
Last week I discovered a data breach involving Pacific Gas and Electric, a very large electric utility company in California. The publicly exposed database appeared to be PG&E’s asset management system. Among other things, it contained details for over 47,000 PG&E computers, virtual machines, servers, and other devices. All of it completely unprotected. No username or password required for viewing.
We’re talking about IP addresses, operating systems, hostnames, locations, MAC addresses, and more. This would be a treasure trove for any hostile nation-state hacking group. That’s not to mention the 120 hashed employee passwords, or the plaintext NTLM, SOAP, and mail passwords.
Does anyone recall a recent example of hackers crippling an electric utility? I do:  https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid
Before going any further I want to let you know that PG&E’s IT department is trying to claim that the database was “fake”. However, I want you to also know that nearly every data breach that I find is initially claimed to be fake. It’s a quick, easy excuse when your company is caught with its pants down and, if it works, you get off free and clear. But that excuse isn’t going to work this time.
Fictitious databases do not generally have areas specifically marked development, production, and enterprise. Fictitious databases do not generally have over 688,000 unique log record entries. This database did.
Sure, it’s theoretically possible to create software that could generate massive amounts of fake data, but companies don’t do that. Even if a database is for development purposes only, they tend to fill it with real production data. They do that because production data is easily available and free. Companies generally do not pay people to sit around and create great swaths of false data when plenty of data already exists to use. I’ve seen it over and over again.
To be clear, I absolutely do not believe PG&E’s claim that this is all fictitious data. They sure took it down quickly after I notified them on Thursday, May 26th.
PG&E didn’t bother to ask me if I downloaded a copy of this open, publicly exposed database. I’ll tell you now that I did. I still have it.
Ultimately, I would like to provide it to the US Department of Homeland Security so that they can 1) determine whether or not the data is genuine; and 2) take appropriate actions in the event that hostile actors also found the database.
So, if you work for DHS and you’re reading this, please contact me at cvickery@kromtech.com if you are interested in verifying the data set and taking appropriate measures to remediate in the event that other parties also obtained a copy.
PG&E Statement
With this incident, it is important to know that none of PG&E’s systems were directly breached in any way and no customer or employee data was involved. 
A PG&E vendor was hosting an online demonstration using PG&E asset management data to show the capabilities of a platform that they were developing for us.  This data contained information on PG&E’s technology assets, such as computers and servers. 
Our initial review indicated that the data was non-sensitive, mocked-up data. We based this feedback on an initial response from the vendor stating that the information in the database was demo or “fake” data. Following further review, we learned that the data was not fake and removed access.
We continue working with all of our vendors to have appropriate procedures in place at all times to protect PG&E data in those instances when they have it.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,60.08000183105469,62.58000183105469,63.93999862670898,62.36000061035156,61.7599983215332,60.9900016784668,60.459999084472656,61.09000015258789,60.58000183105469,66.75,66.62999725341797,67.05000305175781,67.88999938964844,67.0,66.4

Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens urged consumers to monitor their accounts after the reportered breach at O'Charley's restaurants.

Consumers who used credit and debit cards at the restaurants between March 18, 2016 and April 8, 2016 may have been impacted by the breach, Olens said in a written statement.


His office said the restaurant is actively cooperating and consumers are encouraged to take precautionary steps as outlined on O'Charley's website.

The PFI report was submitted to the card networks on June 10, 2016. Based on PFI report, credit cards used at all O'Charley's restaurants (other than three franchised locations) from March 18, 2016, to April 8, 2016 may have been affected. To date, ABRH has reimbursed Fifth Third Bank for fines arising under the MasterCard Security Rules and Procedures (Merchant Edition) in the amount of $0.6 million. Any additional amounts incurred by O'Charley's will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific facts and circumstances of the incident (e.g., how
many cards were actually affected and then used to make unauthorized purchases) and the exercise of discretion by each card network. O'Charley's could also face lawsuits by individual cardholders for unauthorized charges if the individuals are not fully compensated by the card brands. However, individual cardholders generally have no liability for unauthorized charges under the card brand rules, and O'Charley's has received no notice of any such lawsuits to date.",600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company has hired “third party forensic experts” to look into reports of fraudulent charges on customers’ credit cards since January 2016.

Several financial institutions have come forward about patterns they have noticed between fraudulent charges and customers who visited one of Noodles & Company’s stores. After receiving reports from the restaurant’s credit card processor, the company decided to launch an investigation. That process is still ongoing.

Noodles & Company says they are working to get chip-based card readers in their stores in the near future. They released a statement saying they “are actively working with [their] key business partners to deploy this system as soon as they are ready.” Chip credit cards are more difficult to duplicate than traditional magnetic strip cards, so having machines like this in place could help avoid future breaches.

Noodles & Company isn’t the only restaurant to get hit by credit card thieves. Earlier this month, Wendy’s reported that 5% of its franchised stores were involved with a data breach. The thieves installed malicious software on the point of sale terminals in these locations to collect credit card information and other payment details from the registers.

On June 28, 2016, the Company announced that a data security incident may have compromised the security of payment information of some customers who used debit or credit cards at certain Noodles & Company locations between January 31, 2016 and June 2, 2016. Credit and debit cards used at the affected locations are no longer at risk from the malware involved in this incident. The Company has been working to implement additional security procedures to further secure customers’ debit and credit card information.

The Company has incurred costs associated with this security incident as of June 28, 2016, including legal fees, investigative fees and costs of communications with customers. In addition, payment card companies may issue assessments to the Company’s processor for card replacement and card issuer losses alleged to be associated with the security incident. The processor may then seek indemnity from the Company for these costs pursuant to contract. The Company expects that certain of such costs and assessments will be covered under the Company’s cyber liability insurance coverage. At this point, the Company is unable to predict the developments in, outcome of, and economic and other consequences of future litigation or regulatory investigations related to, and other costs associated with, this matter. The Company will continue to evaluate these matters in light of subsequent events, new information and future circumstances.

Currently, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a loss associated with settlements of the payment card networks’ expected claims for non-ordinary course operating expenses or any amounts associated with the networks’ expected claims for alleged card issuer losses and/or card replacement costs because a loss associated with settling such claims, while probable in the Company’s judgment, is not reasonably estimable, in part because the Company has not yet received third-party card issuer loss reporting from the payment card networks. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses related to an expected settlement of the payment card networks’ claims because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. The Company believes that it is possible that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims, to the extent not covered by, or in excess of the limits of, the Company’s cyber liability insurance, could be material to its results of operations in future periods. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.

In addition, the Company expects to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the data security incident in future periods. The Company will recognize these expenses as such services are received. Costs related to the data security incident that may be incurred in future periods may also include liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card issuer losses and card reissuance costs; liabilities from future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

To limit its exposure to losses arising from matters such as the data security incident, the Company maintained cyber liability insurance coverage during the period that the data security incident occurred. This coverage, and certain other customary business insurance coverage, has reduced the Company’s exposure related to the data security incident.

“It was a sophisticated scam that plays on human nature,” Brunswick spokesman Dan Kubera told Trade Only Today.

Someone masquerading as Brunswick management sent emails to team members who would have access to W-2 information, Kubera said.

“In responding to what was believed to be a legitimate request from management, there was an employee who provided some data in an effort to be helpful,” he said.

The incident occurred Friday and the company learned of it later that day when the employee alerted management about the exchange. Kubera wouldn’t say how many employees were affected.

Brunswick is informing affected individuals and notifying the IRS and FBI, and is cooperating with other agencies, as appropriate, Kubera said.

“We’re actively investigating to fully understand the incident. We will be taking any steps we need to prevent an incident like this from occurring in the future.”

ADP reported that the company has learned that a small number of its clients have said some of their employees have been victimized by fraudulent registrations through an ADP self-service portal. The only company so far identified as being involved is U.S. Bancorp. Although, according to a report on KrebsonSecurity, up to a dozen others could be involved.

U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman Dana Ripley told SCMagazine.com that the vulnerability has been resolved for her firm and that  issue may have impacted about two percent of its workforce. The company employees about 60,000 people.

ADP said the situation was created when certain companies posted, to an unsecure website, their unique ADP corporate registration code. This information was then used to create employee ADP accounts. To do this the criminal had to locate an unregistered account and then use the personal identifiable information gleaned from the web in conjunction with the corporate ID number to properly register the individual. Once this was done the bad guys could view that person's W-2 information.

""Registration to the portal requires an access code that is unique to each client company. The company registration code is combined with an individual employee's personal information (e.g., partial SSN, DOB, employee number, etc.) to create a unique access code required for portal registration. In this case, these clients made the unique company registration code available to its employees via an unsecured public website. The combination of an unsecured company registration code and stolen personal information (via phishing, malware, etc.) enabled the fraudulent access to the portal, based on ADP's investigation to date,"" said Dick Wolfe, ADP's 
senior director of corporate communications.

Wolfe reiterated that there is no evidence an ADP system housing employee data was compromised.

One industry observer said both sides were to blame for the situation.

“ADP confirmed a weakness in their customer portal — exacerbated by careless security hygiene on the part of their customer companies — that hackers exploited to access the W-2 data of a number of employees at more than a dozen client firms. As ADP works with more than 640,000 companies, this may only be the tip of the iceberg,” Adam Levin, chairman and founder of IDT911, told SCMagazine.com in an email.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,89.43000030517578,88.08999633789062,92.75,87.97000122070312,90.38999938964844,87.62999725341797,89.9800033569336,95.23999786376952,103.5,96.31999969482422,104.06999969482422,101.2699966430664,104.01000213623048,95.0,94.4

Water might go down the plughole the other way in Australia, but hacks go down the same way. A report on The Sydney Morning Herald said that affected customers have been warned in an email that names, email addresses and phone numbers were exposed in the breach.

""We are writing to let you know that some of your Gumtree account information was compromised in a security attack last weekend,"" said the message.

""The attackers accessed your email address. Contact names and phone numbers, which are made publicly available on the site if provided, were also accessed.""

This is all bad stuff indeed. It's enough personal detail to cause a problem for people, and just enough to be sold online to anyone who wants it. There is also that thing about the reuse of passwords to consider.

Whichever way you look at it, Gumtree has been hacked and its Aussie punters should be hunkering down and working on their security measures.

""We resolved the isolated attack within minutes of discovering it and since then we've taken extra steps to protect your information,"" added Gumtree.

""The safety of our community remains our number one priority and we apologise that you've been affected by this.""

Gumtree is owned by eBay, which hasn't always been particularly good at handling security incidents (imagine someone wearing greased mittens trying to catch eels) and it only seems like yesterday that we watched as the firm really let down its auctioning customers.

Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, in a complaint filed on Tuesday with the International Trade Commission, said a computer belonging to a Pittsburgh researcher was hacked in 2011, and that plans for developing new steel technology were stolen.

​The ITC, an independent agency that reviews and enforces U.S. trade policy, has within 30 calendar days to decide whether to launch an investigation. The agency typically investigates complaints. U.S. Steel says it expects any ITC probe resulting from its complaint “to reveal that the Chinese government disseminated U.S. Steel’s trade secrets to” Chinese steelmakers, “enabling them to manufacture [lightweight steels] that [compete] with U.S. Steel’s products.”

In a statement Wednesday, China’s Commerce Ministry urged U.S. authorities to reject U.S. Steel’s trade complaint, and said that allegations of intellectual property infringement “are completely without factual basis.” The Commerce Ministry on Thursday didn’t respond to a request for comment on the hacking allegations by U.S. Steel.

U.S. Steel’s allegations are the latest escalation in a mounting trade fight over China’s massive production and exports of industrial metals, especially aluminum and steel.


The U.S. government has imposed new duties on Chinese steel imports this year and started a formal investigation into overproduction of aluminum that could lead to new tariffs. Steel imports into the U.S. have slowed this year, but steelmakers complain that the massive volume of overall Chinese steel exports—in 2015, more than 100 million tons, or 7% of global production—has had knock-on effects, deflating prices around the world, including in the U.S.

The steel-hungry auto industry is a key battleground.

With the U.S. and other governments implementing tougher fuel efficiency standards, auto makers need lighter metals. That’s translated into massive and lucrative new demand, including for steel’s competitor, aluminum. By 2025, 18% of all vehicles are expected to have all-aluminum bodies, compared with less than 1% in 2014.

Steelmakers are fighting back with so-called advanced high strength steel, which is made by changing the alloying chemistry, and the heating and cooling process. The stakes are huge, with auto makers around the world buying tens of billions of dollars a year of steel and aluminum. To boot, this kind of high-tech steel also has military applications, such as armored vehicles.

Developing this steel is a priority for U.S. Steel, which posted a loss of $1.5 billion last year. Its factories in Indiana and Ohio are geared toward supplying Detroit auto makers, and it has spent millions of dollars conducting research into new steels. With demand sagging for other steel products, like construction materials and oil and gas pipes, it needs contracts from car makers to survive, analysts say.

Chinese steelmakers have been chasing the same prize, but around 2010, according to U.S. Steel’s complaint, they had fallen behind and were losing contracts for supplying car companies with lighter steels.

U.S. Steel says its forensic analysis into the alleged 2011 hacking revealed that the alleged culprits were based in China, and that the methods were similar to those used by the Chinese hackers indicted in 2014 by a grand jury in Western Pennsylvania. China’s Foreign Ministry at the time said the accusations were based on “fabricated facts, grossly violates the basic norms governing international relations and jeopardizes China-U.S. cooperation and mutual trust.”

The hackers in the 2014 case allegedly worked for the Chinese military and stole price information and technological documents from U.S. Steel, Alcoa Inc., the United Steelworkers union and other entities to help companies win contract bids and trade disputes, according to court documents. Five military hackers were charged on 31 counts of thefts, computer fraud and economic espionage. No arrests have been made.

U.S. Steel says the 2011 cyberattack was conducted using a method similar to that allegedly used by the military hackers charged in the 2014 federal case. While the company didn’t provide evidence of a Chinese government hack in its published complaint, it said the hacking fit the pattern of previous cyberattacks involving the Chinese government. A program inserted in a U.S. Steel computer “contacted an Internet domain linked to a Chinese hacker group,” according to this week’s complaint. The hackers then turned over their findings to Chinese steelmakers, U.S. Steel alleges.

Chinese steelmakers “weren’t able to compete in these markets,” John Packard, publisher of Steel Market Update, a trade publication and consultancy, said in an interview. Steel mills in the U.S. “have invested millions of dollars in these new steels.”

The plans that U.S. Steel says were stolen included the chemistry for the alloy and its coating, the necessary temperature for heating and cooling the metal, and the layout of production lines. It says hackers stole designs for making one of U.S. Steel’s most valuable products, a metal known as Dual-Phase 980 that could withstand more than 140,000 pounds per square inch, placing it among the best performers.

Two years after the alleged hacking, Chinese state-owned steel giant Baosteel Group Corp., the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker by volume in 2014, according to the World Steel Association, had a new line of products on the market, U.S. Steel says. Among them: Dual-Phase 980.

U.S. Steel says it expects to show the product was made using technology stolen in the alleged 2011 hacking, and turned over to Baosteel. According to U.S. Steel, “since 2013, Baosteel has directly shipped ultra high-strength steel to the United States, causing and threatening to cause substantial injury to U.S. Steel’s domestic industry.”

In a response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, Baosteel called the latest accusations “complete nonsense.”

“Baosteel has consistently acted in accordance with regulations; respected intellectual property rights; and attached great importance to independent research and development and technological progress,” the company said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,18.25,14.279999732971193,15.989999771118164,21.309999465942386,20.06999969482422,19.549999237060547,19.46999931335449,33.22999954223633,35.779998779296875,32.150001525878906,37.0099983215332,32.81999969482422,31.11000061035156,16.0,26.222222222222218

The Company’s information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and to a lesser extent in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, the Company utilizes several third party data centers throughout the U.S. Landstar relies in the regular course of its business on the proper operation of its information technology systems to link its extensive network of customers, agents and third party capacity providers, including its BCO Independent Contractors. Although the Company has redundant systems for its critical operations, any significant disruption or failure of its technology systems or those of third party data centers on which it relies could significantly disrupt the Company’s operations and impose significant costs on the Company. Moreover, it is critical that the data processed by or stored in the Company’s information technology systems or otherwise in the Company’s possession remain confidential, as it often includes confidential, proprietary and/or competitively sensitive information regarding our customers, agents and third party capacity providers, employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics. Cyber incidents that impact the security, availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and data, including outages, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions, could have a significant impact on our operations. Accordingly, information security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust security procedures and other safeguards in place, as threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. For example, in the first quarter of 2016, we were subject to “spear-phishing” attacks through which third parties were able to obtain personal employee data. We have undertaken a number of remedial measures in response, including enhancing our security systems and additional training for our employees. Additional incidents may occur in the future and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. A significant incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, agents or third party capacity providers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.

It was well-timed, arriving on Thursday, April 30, during a tumultuous period for the Los-Angeles based maker of Barbie dolls. Barbie was bombing, particularly overseas, and the CEO, Christopher Sinclair, had officially taken over only that month. Mattel had fired his predecessor.

The finance executive who got the note was naturally eager to please her new boss. She double-checked protocol. Fund transfers required approval from two high-ranking managers. She qualified and so did the CEO, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. He declined to reveal the finance executive's name.

Satisfied, the executive wired over $3 million to the Bank of Wenzhou, in China.

Hours later, she mentioned the payment to Sinclair.

But he hadn't made any such request.

Frantic, Mattel executives called their U.S. bank, the police and the FBI.

The response? You're out of luck. The money's already in China.

Mattel's millions were swept up in a tide of dirty money that passes through China and that Western police are only beginning to understand. The scam the company fell victim to — known as the fake CEO or fake president scam — has cost companies, many of them American, more than $1.8 billion, according to the FBI. Most of the stolen money passes through banks in China or Hong Kong, the FBI said.

An Associated Press investigation this week showed that China is emerging as a global hub for money laundering. The dark money that courses through China has long been considered a domestic issue, with Chinese illicitly moving money for other Chinese. That's no longer the case. Mounting evidence indicates that China is becoming a global banker for the criminal economy, according to interviews with police officials, court records in the U.S. and Europe, and intelligence documents reviewed by the AP.

Years of mutual mistrust have hindered law enforcement cooperation between China and the West, adding to China's appeal as a money laundering hub. The U.S. State Department said in a report this month that China has ""not cooperated sufficiently on financial investigations."" China's inability to enforce U.S. court orders on China-based assets ""remains a significant barrier to enhanced U.S.-China cooperation,"" it added.

In a regular briefing with reporters on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that the government ""places great emphasis"" on fighting crimes such as money laundering and is working to expand international cooperation. ""China is not, has not been, nor will be in the future a center of global money laundering,"" he said.

Mattel wasn't going to let go of $3 million without a fight. What the company really needed was luck. And when it came to Mattel's China operations, luck had been in short supply.

Mattel's misadventures in China are so spectacular they've become the stuff of business school seminars. In 2007, Mattel recalled 19 million made-in-China toys, including Pixar cars covered in lead paint and Barbie sets embedded with tiny, hazardous magnets. Then, in 2009, Mattel opened the ""House of Barbie,"" a glowing pink, six-story shrine on one of Shanghai's ritziest shopping boulevards. It had a spiral staircase encased with over 800 Barbie dolls, a spa and a fashion runway. But the flagship flopped, and Mattel closed it after just two years.

Rising costs and labor shortages weighed on China production, even as the $5.7 billion toy giant limped back into the Chinese market with dolls — including a Violin Soloist Barbie — aimed at Chinese ""tiger moms.""

The thieves struck as Mattel was aggressively pushing its China business, positioning itself as a child development brand, which helped grow China sales 43 percent in 2015 over the prior year. They had done their homework, mining social media and likely hacking corporate emails to penetrate Mattel's corporate hierarchy and payment patterns, according to the person familiar with the investigation.

The criminals had the $3 million sent to Wenzhou, a gritty enclave on China's eastern coast that is emerging as a significant transit point in global money laundering networks. The city is the destination for 90 percent of the funds stolen through fake CEO scams in Europe, according to an intelligence memo reviewed by the AP.

Wenzhou city officials declined to comment.

Squeezed by mountains against the sea, Wenzhou is known as the birthplace of underground finance in China.

Decades of official neglect allowed an unusual, business-oriented culture to thrive here. After Mao's anti-capitalist rule, a private economy began to re-emerge in Wenzhou in the late 1970s. But those first peasant entrepreneurs — and the informal financing mechanisms that sprang up around them — inhabited a legal gray zone, said Chen Zongshi, an assistant sociology professor at Zhejiang University. It would be a decade before Wenzhou was officially authorized to develop private enterprise, according to Zongshi. Those regulations were among the first in China.

Poverty, underdevelopment and a lack of arable land also made Wenzhou an ideal place to leave. Strivers heading for Europe and North America poured out of Wenzhou, and in their wake, the informal financial systems that served the area's entrepreneurs went global.

Today, money that ends up in Wenzhou doesn't have to stay there — thanks in part to the pawn shops and corner grocery stores that quietly double as money-transfer agents, said Yan Lixin, the secretary general of the China Center for Anti-Money Laundering Studies at Shanghai's Fudan University.

""From Wenzhou, the money could scatter to any other place,"" he said.

Luck arrived for Mattel in the form of a bank holiday. Friday, May 1, was Labor Day in China.

That, crucially, gave Mattel time. The company notified Chinese police, who quickly launched a criminal investigation, according to a letter from Mattel thanking Chinese authorities, which was obtained by the AP.

When the Bank of Wenzhou opened the following Monday, a China-based anti-fraud executive from Mattel strode past the sculpted lions that flank the entrance to the bank's headquarters, marched upstairs to the International Business Department and presented a letter from the FBI, according to two people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Chinese police froze the account that very morning. Two days later, on May 6, Mattel got its money back, according to the letter.

Mattel wrote that the Wenzhou police ""showed a great sense of responsibility and enforcement capability.""

""We hereby reiterate our appreciation,"" Mattel wrote. ""We also hope that this case can pave the way for future international cooperation in fighting similar transnational crimes.""

International cooperation has grown in importance for Beijing. China's ruling Communist Party is campaigning to purge corruption from its ranks, pursuing officials who have fled overseas with ill-gotten wealth, in an effort to shore up its legitimacy as China's economy slows.

""If we need help getting corrupt officials or bribes back, we need to offer assistance when other countries need it too,"" said Huang Feng, Director of the Institute for International Criminal Law at Beijing Normal University. ""The problem is not that the Chinese authorities have been uncooperative, it's that we don't have a relevant legal framework to implement.""

He said Mattel fought the fraud correctly, imploring Chinese authorities to use Chinese law to get the money back.

The Bank of Wenzhou confirmed that its staff handled Mattel's case but declined to comment. Police in Wenzhou confirmed that an investigation was ongoing but declined to discuss details. Mattel also declined to comment for this story, citing the ongoing investigation.

Since its near miss in Wenzhou, Mattel has tracked a dozen more attempted hacks.

vzbzEarlier this week, a prominent member of a closely guarded underground cybercrime forum posted a new thread advertising the sale of a database containing the contact information on some 1.5 million customers of Verizon Enterprise.

The seller priced the entire package at $100,000, but also offered to sell it off in chunks of 100,000 records for $10,000 apiece. Buyers also were offered the option to purchase information about security vulnerabilities in Verizon’s Web site.

Contacted about the posting, Verizon Enterprise told KrebsOnSecurity that the company recently identified a security  flaw in its site that permitted hackers to steal customer contact information, and that it is in the process of alerting affected customers.

“Verizon recently discovered and remediated a security vulnerability on our enterprise client portal,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our investigation to date found an attacker obtained basic contact information on a number of our enterprise customers. No customer proprietary network information (CPNI) or other data was accessed or accessible.”

The seller of the Verizon Enterprise data offers the database in multiple formats, including the database platform MongoDB, so it seems likely that the attackers somehow forced the MongoDB system to dump its contents. Verizon has not yet responded to questions about how the breach occurred, or exactly how many customers were being notified.

The irony in this breach is that Verizon Enterprise is typically the one telling the rest of the world how these sorts of breaches take place.  I frequently recommend Verizon’s annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) because each year’s is chock full of interesting case studies from actual breaches, case studies that include hard lessons which mostly age very well (i.e., even a DBIR report from four years ago has a great deal of relevance to today’s security challenges).

According to the 2015 report, for example, Verizon Enterprise found that organized crime groups were the most frequently seen threat actor for Web application attacks of the sort likely exploited in this instance. “Virtually every attack in this data set (98 percent) was opportunistic in nature, all aimed at easy marks,” the company explained.

It’s a fair bet that if cyber thieves buy all or some of the Verizon Enterprise customer database, some of those customers may be easy marks for phishing and other targeted attacks. Even if it is limited to the contact data for technical managers at companies that use Verizon Enterprise Solutions, this is bound to be target-rich list: According to Verizon’s page at Wikipedia, some 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies are using Verizon Enterprise Solutions.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,52.90999984741211,50.54999923706055,49.13999938964844,54.66999816894531,56.099998474121094,52.63000106811523,52.56000137329102,48.209999084472656,50.22999954223633,53.68000030517578,52.40999984741211,50.31000137329102,49.63999938964844,53.0,52.875

""Sprouts is working with the FBI and the IRS to investigate this crime and to determine the best ways to protect team member tax information. Anyone who received a W-2 form from Sprouts for 2015 may be impacted,"" she said. 

Sprouts joins Seagate, Snapchat and several other high profile firms that have been hit with a similar attack.

Security executives all pointed out the difficulty of preventing socially-engineered phishing attacks, but at the same time agreed that companies must better educate staffers on security issues, while incorporating some basic changes that make it harder for the average payroll employee to make such a monumental mistake.

“The question to ask about the Sprouts data breach is why that payroll employee had on-demand access to so much sensitive information? If a payroll employee wants one W-2, then maybe you just let them have it. If that same employee wants all of them all at once, then there should be something that triggers to say this is a different sort of request that deserves more scrutiny,” said Jonathan Sander, vice president at Lieberman Software to SCMagazine.com in an email Tuesday.

Nathan Sorrentino, marketing program manager at STEALTHbits Technologies, said education is another building block in the wall needed to safeguard data.

“Until organizations become more proactive in training their employees to look for the signs of this now all-too-common phishing scam, the attacks will continue into the foreseeable future,” he told SCMagazine.com in an email.

There are also some immediate practical steps and technology that can be implemented to help correct for human error.

“As a best practice, personal identifiable information should never be transmitted in an un-encrypted format,” said Brad Bussie, director of product management at STEALTHbits Technologies.

Craig Young, computer security researcher at Tripwire, suggested companies try something old fashioned: Simply double check that the request is legitimate.

“In general, whenever a request is received to send sensitive personal information outside of regular business processes, it is always a good idea to validate the request through a separate channel such as via telephone,” he told SCMagazine.com today.", ,,ND,,,,,,,1:16-cv-00855-MJW | 2:16-cv-024047-DLR,	Baker & Hostetler LLP | Squire Patton Boggs,	Sawaya Law Firm | Aegis Law Firm PC,0.0,29.51000022888184,27.75,24.479999542236328,22.100000381469727,23.149999618530273,22.96999931335449,20.450000762939453,21.209999084472656,21.63999938964844,19.700000762939453,18.8700008392334,19.0,22.770000457763672,34.0,34.0

March 17, 2016
On behalf of Advance Auto Parts, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that exposed some employee
information about you. We take the protection of employee information very seriously. This is why we are contacting
you directly to let you know what occurred and how we are responding to assist you.
WHAT HAPPENED. On March 7, 2016, a third party obtained unauthorized access to employee information. This
access was through a phishing-type attack in which an outside party posing as an Advance employee convinced an
employee to provide a file containing information about certain individuals who worked for Advance during 2015. The
employee believed the email request for this file was a legitimate internal data request. The information was not
obtained through a breach of Advance’s information systems.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED. The employee information involved included your name, your Social
Security number, your 2015 gross wages, and the state(s) in which you pay income taxes.
WHAT WE ARE DOING. We learned of and began investigating the matter on March 7 and quickly determined the
nature and scope of the incident. We also notified federal law enforcement of this incident, requesting that they
investigate fully. We are currently communicating to all relevant current and former employees and are offering free
identity protection services and hotline support. We will continue to assess any additional actions needed to protect
our employee information.
WHAT YOU CAN DO. We recommend that you review the information provided in this letter for some steps that you
may take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your personal information.

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:
Seagate Technology is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of our employees’ personal information.
Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving the unauthorized disclosure of this information.
What Happened?
On March 1, 2016, we learned that a targeted “phishing” email message had been sent from outside the company
to Seagate employees. Phishing emails are an attempt by an individual or group to solicit personal information
from unsuspecting users by employing social engineering techniques. Phishing emails are crafted to appear as if
they have been sent from a legitimate organization or known individual. In this case, the phishing email targeted
Seagate employees in HR and Payroll, requesting copies of all 2015 Forms W-2, and unfortunately the email was not
recognized as a scam. The information disclosed was the actual W-2 information, including the names, addresses,
Social Security numbers, and earnings for anyone who was a Seagate or Seagate affiliate employee and was issued
a W-2 for the 2015 tax year.
The IRS and federal law enforcement have been notified of this incident. The IRS has reported that several other
companies have been targeted by this type of scheme. The IRS has also indicated to us that they will add extra
scrutiny to affected employees’ accounts for this year, in an effort to prevent fraudulent tax refunds from being paid
out.
What Information Was Involved?
The information involved in this incident included the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and earnings for
anyone who was a Seagate or Seagate affiliate employee and was issued a W-2 for the 2015 tax year.
What We Are Doing.
Seagate is offering you at least a two-year membership in Experian’s® ProtectMyID® Alert. This product helps
detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on
immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is completely free to you and enrolling
in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and ProtectMyID
Alert, including instructions on how to activate your two-year membership, please see the additional information
provided with this letter. We strongly recommend that you follow these instructions to activate your membership as
soon as possible.
We deeply regret that this incident has occurred and that the privacy and security of your personal information was
not protected as it should have been. At the company level, we are aggressively analyzing where process changes are
needed, and will take the appropriate actions. We will supplement the phishing training conducted for all employees
with additional training and further information in the near future.

Taobao is owned by China’s online giant, Alibaba, and offers what’s known as C2C, or consumer-to-consumer, retail.

In the online C2C world, where you’re not buying from a website, but rather through it, regular sellers succeed or fail on their history and reputation.

Creating a new, fraudulent account and trying to sell hooky goods is not enough, because a crook needs to build up some credibility – happy buyers, basically – before things really start to move.

The idea is that the ecosystem becomes self-policing, because you’ll quickly be outed and exposed if you rip people off, and the details of your treachery will be there for everyone to see, such as goods never sent, substandard products, dishonoured refunds and so on.

You could create your own additional network of fake accounts that publish glowing reviews, or that jump into online bidding to inflate your prices, but that’s hard to do convincingly.

Or you could go after other people’s logins in order to “borrow” their reputation, offer positive feedback in their name, or even to influence the bidding.

(If you accidentally win the bidding for your own item via someone else’s account, you can just logout and walk away, leaving the hapless user with the problem of a purchase that they refuse to go through with.)

That’s what seems to have been happening in China, in what seems to have been a data breach of staggering proportions.

As in many data breach cases, what actually happened isn’t yet clear, even though it started in October 2015.

WHAT WE THINK HAPPENED

The crooks acquired a database of close to 100 million email addresses and passwords from an unknown source, presumably one or more previous breaches, none to do with Alibaba.
Starting in October 2015, the crooks used servers hosted on Alibaba’s cloud server platform to try all these email addresses in Taobao logins.
The crooks actually managed to log in to nearly 21 million Taobao accounts, thanks to the existing account information.
The hacked accounts were exploited for fake reviews and fake bidding, as described above.
WHAT WE DON’T YET KNOW

Where did the original, giant database of login information came from?
If it was a single breach of its own, this list of 100 million user identities would to be five times as big a breach as this one!

Did the original data include plaintext passwords, hashed passwords, or password hints?
Taobao allows you to register an account using your phone number, a username, or your email address, so any list of working Chinese email addresses would be a fruitful starting point for a password guessing attack, where you just pick off the users with 12345678, qwertyuiop or 淘宝网 as their passwords.

But with plaintext passwords exposed from an earlier attack, the crooks wouldn’t need to guess at all; and with hashed passwords stolen, the crooks could have mounted an offline attack to figure out some of the passwords in advance.

Would victims have avoided trouble by following our advice of “one account, one password.”
Assume that your password wasn’t easily guessable “from scratch,” and that the stolen user account data had nothing to do with Alibaba in the first place, as claimed.

You’d have been safe on Taobao if you’d had a different password for every account, because the password figured out by the crooks from the original breach would be no use to them on any other site.

Should the Taobao authentication servers have spotted the repetitious login attempts by the crooks as suspicious?
Rate limiting, which is where a service slows down or locks you out after too many unusual connection attempts, can be a huge barrier to cybercriminality.

ATMs do it, for example: even if you only have a 5-digit PIN on your bank card, it’s fairly safe because the machine cancels and swallows the card after three mistakes.

One problem in this case is that with nearly 100 million account names to work with, the crooks didn’t need to try thousands of passwords per account to get a good hit rate, so Taobao may not have seen evidence of massive password guessing.

Taobao, one imagines, would have to detect and react to different logins from the same or a similar part of the internet.

But Taobao is one of the busiest websites in the world, so processing hundreds of millions of logins, even it they come from the same internet region (here, from Alibaba’s cloud network), is all in a day’s work.

In cybersecurity, spotting attack patterns is often really easy…the second time it happens!

WHAT TO DO?

If you’re a Taobao user, change your password if you haven’t been forced to already. This time, make sure you choose something strong and unique.
Turn on 2FA for services that support it. 2FA is two-factor authentication, where you need a one-time code as well as your password every time you log in.
Watch those logs. If you run online services of your own, get into the habit of looking for suspicious activity. You may not yet know what patterns will reveal future attacks, but if you don’t look, you’ll definitely never spot them.
Apply some sort of rate limiting on your login pages. You can give crooks a generous allowance of failed logins and still slow then down enormously, without having any effect on legitimate users. Too many different logins from the same place, too many identical logins from different places, and too many failed passwords for the same account, are obvious warning signs.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,64.86000061035156,72.22000122070312,79.08000183105469,75.81999969482422,76.62000274658203,78.97000122070312,84.75,99.25,105.4499969482422,97.56999969482422,90.98999786376952,90.51000213623048,100.38999938964844,630.816,651.0226666666667

The acknowledgment comes in response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity about banking industry sources who discovered a pattern of fraud on cards that were all recently used at various Wendy’s locations.

wen2Bob Bertini, spokesperson for the Dublin, Ohio-based restauranteur, said the company began receiving reports earlier this month from its payment industry contacts about a potential breach and that Wendy’s has hired a security firm to investigate the claims.

“We have received this month from our payment industry contacts reports of unusual activity involving payment cards at some of our restaurant locations,” Bertini said. “Reports indicate that fraudulent charges may have occurred elsewhere after the cards were legitimately used at some of our restaurants. We’ve hired a cybersecurity firm and launched a comprehensive and active investigation that’s underway to try to determine the facts.”

Bertini said it was too soon to say whether the incident is contained, how long it may have persisted, or how many stores may be affected.

“We began investigating immediately, and the period of time we’re looking at the incidents is late last year,” he said. “We know it’s [affecting] some restaurants but it’s not appropriate just yet to speculate on anything in terms of scope.”

When KrebsOnSecurity initially began hearing from banking industry sources about a possible breach at Wendy’s, the reports were coming mainly from financial institutions in the midwest. However, this author has since heard similar reports from banks on the east coast on the United States.

The Wendy’s system includes approximately 6,500 franchise and company-operated restaurants in the United States and 28 countries and U.S. territories worldwide. Bertini said most of the U.S.-operated stores are franchises.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/30697/000119312516617956/0001193125-16-617956-index.htm,2016-06-09 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/30697/000003069716000011/twc10k2015.htm,Risk Factors,2016-03-03 00:00:00,"The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees. A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. The Company is also investigating unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants, as further described below. As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those it has outsourced. The three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to the relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and private data exposure. In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. However, these measures, as well as its increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.

Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from their customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing. The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations. The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations. If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and could disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations. A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations.

As reported in the news media in late January, the Company has engaged cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation into unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants. Out of the locations investigated to date, some have been found by the cybersecurity experts to have malware on a certain system.

Information security consultant Paul Moore estimates that over 19 million transactions were potentially at risk in that period.

In March 2014, Mr Moore contacted Asda “to report several security vulnerabilities” that he’d discovered in its website, but nothing was done to fix them. After 677 days, he says, his patience ran out, so he blogged about it, explaining his proof of concept in a handy video: “all that’s required for this exploit to be successful is for you to be signed in and browsing the web. If, at the end of your shop, you search for a voucher or discount code and that website contains the same malicious payload, you could potentially lose your card details.”


Walmart subsidiary Asda fixed the vulnerability shortly after Mr Moore published his blog on Monday, telling the BBC: “Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website.”

Patch management

The exploitation of known vulnerabilities is one of the easiest methods by which cyber criminals can hack websites, so the importance of maintaining up-to-date software is paramount for all organisations that value their information security. If you continue to use unsupported or vulnerable versions, then your website runs a significantly higher risk of compromise.

Penetration testing

If you’re unsure about your patch management practices and are concerned about your organisation’s susceptibility to online attack, you’ll be interested in IT Governance’s penetration testing packages. Designed to identify vulnerabilities and provide remedial measures that you can take to secure your systems, they provide a complete solution for the routine security testing of your websites and IT systems to ensure that your networks and applications remain secure against cyber attacks.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,62.56000137329102,64.66000366210939,66.94999694824219,69.76999664306639,69.19999694824219,71.0999984741211,73.66000366210938,72.80999755859375,72.08999633789062,68.88999938964844,68.54000091552734,71.58000183105469,67.62000274658203,62.0,63.574285714285715

I want to address this issue for our customers, and for the industry, to clarify some items.

A threat actor has said he gained access to a single server used to stage content for the GoTo family of web sites, a server configured for easy access to web site content and marketing campaign materials. The content management server under question did not contain any customer, employee or other sensitive or confidential information. 

Although the content management server allowed anonymous access to content, anonymous access is insufficient to write metadata changes to production. Claims that a threat actor could modify production web site content, web server configurations, or access internal Citrix systems are not factual. The server has been reconfigured, and administrative passwords have been changed.

Also, I want to clarify some confusion concerning ShareFile. While in this outwardly facing content management system, the threat actor identified a password to a ShareFile account which contained previously disclosed images and other marketing materials. Related, the threat actor identified an application programming interface token for the read-only rights to this ShareFile account. Again, no customer, employee or other sensitive or confidential information was exposed, and this old, unused ShareFIle account has been disabled and the read-only API key to this account revoked.

Finally, we have no evidence that this threat actor has accessed systems other than the single content management server. We will continue to monitor the environment for unauthorized access and changes.

Use of our products and services may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances customers' business and personally identifiable information. Thus, maintaining the security of products, computer networks and data storage resources is important as security breaches could result in product or service vulnerabilities and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our products and services through our efforts to engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features in our products and services, deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact. Despite our efforts, from time to time, we experience attacks and other cyber-threats, none of which to our knowledge have resulted in data exfiltration. Generally speaking, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, product or service vulnerabilities or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that directly or indirectly, for example, through a vendor or other third-party, attack our products, services or networks, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, services and networks. Because techniques used by these perpetrators to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security breaches.
A breach of our security measures as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could result in (among other consequences):
•
harm to our reputation or brand, which could lead some customers to seek to cancel subscriptions, stop using certain of our products or services, reduce or delay future purchases of our products or services, or use competing products or services;
•
individual and/or class action lawsuits, which could result in financial judgments against us or the payment of settlement amounts, which would cause us to incur legal fees and costs;
•
state or federal enforcement action, which could result in fines and/or penalties or other sanctions and which would cause us to incur legal fees and costs; and/or
•
in the event that we or one of our customers were the victim of a cyberattack or other security breach, additional costs associated with responding to such breach, such as investigative and remediation costs, and the costs of providing data owners or others with notice of the breach, legal fees, costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by such customers' credit card issuers, and costs incurred by credit card issuers associated with the compromise and additional monitoring of systems for further fraudulent activity.

We collect and retain certain sensitive personal data. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses collect, use, and retain large amounts of confidential personal and financial information from their customers and clients, including information regarding income, assets, family members, credit cards, tax returns, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of our customers, clients and advisors, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our customers' and clients’ personal information. A major breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may have materially negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. We may detect, or we may receive notices from customers or clients or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers, our software, or third-party software components that are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer and client confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
We are subject to laws, regulations, and industry rules relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. We expect regulation in this area to increase. As a result of our current data protection policies and practices may not be sufficient and thus may require modification. New regulations may require notification to customers, clients, or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, and hinder our ability to acquire new, or market to, existing customers and clients. As our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, our compliance requirements and costs may increase. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations.
In addition, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that can be used to attack our offerings. Although we utilize network and application security measures, internal controls, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. Any such incident may materially harm our business, reputation, and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations. In addition, our employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) and contractors may have access to sensitive and

personal information of our customers, clients, and employees. While we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach. In addition, we rely on third party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data. While we conduct due diligence on these third party partners with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures, and, in any event, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls, resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer, client, or employee information and data.
Despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity and technology risks, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers’ and clients’ personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers, clients, or advisors, or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance is subject to exclusions and may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks as well as the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate security measures. We could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins, inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our businesses.",0,,,,,,,9.010000228881836,7.510000228881836,5.510000228881836,5.110000133514403,8.739999771118164,8.75,11.68000030517578,11.140000343322754,10.6899995803833,11.489999771118164,13.100000381469727,15.350000381469727,14.899999618530273,20.0,20.0

According to a company representative, the FBI found information about 320,000 Time Warner Cable customers, information that included customer email addresses, and their associated passwords.

The information was relayed to Time Warner's tech team who started an investigation to verify its validity and the possible source of the data leak.

Various Time Warner representatives have told multiple media agencies that they don't believe the data originated from a breach of its servers.

Company spokespersons believe that the data may have been stolen from other firms that also handle Time Warner customer information, but they also believe some of the data may come from individual phishing campaigns, collected from one user at a time.

There are secret black markets on the Internet where cybercriminals often trade, buy, or sell entire batches of customer details from various companies. It may be possible that the database of 320,000 Time Warner clients may be a collection gathered from different incidents across time. It may also be possible that most of the data may be already obsolete, from long-past incidents or accounts for which the password was already changed.

Most of the data points to TWC Road Runner customers

Time Warner representatives have told CSO that their staff will start contacting each affected user via email and encourage them to change their passwords.

According to an NBC report, inside sources claim that most of the data seems to be email addresses associated with the Road Runner (rr.com) service, a Web mail service managed by Time Warner.

""Anytime an unfortunate event such as a hack or password leak happens, there is a lesson to be learned by the customers, end users and the vendor,"" Mr. Shahbazi also added.

""Well in this case, based on the investigation that we've done so far and where these fraudulent accounts are being used, we believe that it's probably being transferred somewhere outside of the united states. Hopefully they'll be able to go into the computer system and determine - either through an IP address or some other means - where the information is being sent to,"" Lt. Brian Zalewski said.

In the last 24 hours V&J Foods - which owns the Burger King - has reached out to authorities for assistance. Now a Milwaukee Police Department computer forensic special is getting involved.

""We do have options. We do have equipment and investigators who are trained to do these things but we need consent to go and access the computer system of a business which, in this case, we feel it's their computer system that's causing the problem,"" Lt. Zalewski said.

November 23, 2015

We recently were made aware that an unauthorized third party placed malware on Pearson VUE’s Credential Manager System—which is used by adult learners to support professional certifications and licenses. The unauthorized third party improperly accessed certain information related to a limited set of our users.

This issue does not affect other Pearson systems. Our analysis to date indicates that the issue is isolated to Pearson VUE’s Credential Manager System. There is no indication that other systems have been affected.

Pearson VUE’s Credential Manager System is a stand-alone system that provides support to adults in a limited number of professional fields. The issue does not affect the wider scope of Pearson VUE systems, such as the Pearson VUE testing system or PearsonVUE.com. It is also important to note that this issue does not affect other Pearson systems, such as those supporting K-12 student assessments

With respect to the Credential Manager System, we are still assessing the scope of the specific data elements involved. As of now, we do not believe that U.S. Social Security numbers or full payment card information were compromised as a result of this issue.  Because the Credential Manager System is custom designed to fit specific customer requirements, we are working to understand how this issue may have affected each of our customers.

We are working with law enforcement and leading third-party forensic experts to assess and verify the scope of the issue and related facts. Customer privacy is a top priority for us and we take this responsibility very seriously. For the time being, the Pearson VUE PCM System remains offline. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

We have been updating affected customers and will continue to do so. We have also set up a dedicated hotline to assist users with any questions or concerns they may have: (855) 270-9182 or +1 (512) 201-2203 for international users.”", ,,ND,,,, ,,,,,,,12.229999542236328,11.029999732971193,10.859999656677246,11.529999732971193,12.920000076293945,11.920000076293945,11.699999809265135,12.850000381469727,12.729999542236328,11.420000076293945,10.199999809265137,9.489999771118164,9.649999618530273,234.9535,188.201

The McLean, Va., company becomes the latest hotel operator to be hacked during a recent flurry of security breaches over the past two years. Hilton’s announcement comes just days after Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. said hackers had stolen customer credit-card and debit-card information in a breach that lasted nearly eight months at 54 locations.

The Trump Hotel Collection and Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group are among the other brands that previously warned guests about potential security breaches.

At Hilton, it is unclear how many of its 4,500 hotels world-wide have been affected. The company is asking all its guests who stayed at Hilton properties from during certain dates in November and December last year, and from April 21 to July 27, 2015, to review their payment card statements for signs of fraud.

Hilton said malicious software, known as malware, infiltrated payments systems at hotel restaurants, gift shops and other hotel locations with registers. The malware may have collected customer names, card numbers, security codes and expiration dates, Hilton said.

“Hilton Worldwide worked closely with third-party forensics experts, law enforcement and payment card companies on this investigation, and determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware,” the company said Tuesday in a statement. “Hilton immediately launched an investigation and has further strengthened its systems.”

The breach highlights a security weakness at many hotels, which have proven vulnerable to hackers who target point-of-sale devices.

Consumers aren’t liable for unauthorized purchases made on their cards, but breaches can sometimes enable hackers to use the information to create counterfeit cards.

From time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. The techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. In November 2015, we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some point-of-sale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware. We expect we will be subject to additional cyber-attacks in the future and may experience data breaches.

Even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us.

About 200,000 Comcast customers have been asked to reset their passwords. The company was alerted to the posting on Saturday. A company representative said no company systems had been compromised, and that it was actively involved in checking the list against its own database of customers.

About 30 percent of the data for sale was from active accounts, so the majority of the information was likely obtained through the accidental release of passwords by customers or recycled from past data breaches.

Casey’s (www.caseys.com) is an independently-owned convenience store chain in the Midwest that operates 1,887 stores in 14 states. While the chain, as well as all retailers industry-wide, has been preparing for the remediations needed to comply with the EMV Liability Shift Mandate, most companies' attention has been placed on point-of-sale (POS) and mobile POS devices that process credit and debit card products. However, savvy cyber-criminals are looking for loopholes. One potential vulnerability allowing cyber-thieves to infiltrate enterprise databases is less-protected peripheral devices, such as fuel pump readers. 
 
For Casey’s, hackers installed credit card skimming devices at pumps across six of its stores in Nebraska and one store in Iowa. It is these types of cyber-attacks that helped push the evolution of EMV. 
 
The payment security remediation that promises better secure data, and insulate retailers from liability costs incurred from data breaches, the EMV Liability Shift Mandate went live on October 1, 2015. EMV guidelines requires retail brands to accept EMV cards containing microprocessor chips that create a unique code for each transaction — a practice that protects consumers’ payment card information. Howver, new guidelines also make non-EMV-compliant retailers responsible for any credit card fraud committed in their stores, according to “Preparing for the Fast-Approaching EMV Mandate,” a report from RIS News. 
 
Upon discovering of the first device, Casey’s immediately removed the tainted devices, and notified law enforcement authorities and credit card companies. The c-store chain also instituted additional company-wide pump inspection procedures at all stores. 
 
While it is currently undetermined if any credit card information has been compromised, Casey’s encourages customers who used debit, credit, or any other payment cards at fuel pumps at the affected Nebraska locations between October 2, and October 10, 2015, and the Iowa location between October 15, and October 21, 2015, to closely monitor their financial accounts and credit reports. Customers should promptly contact their financial institutions if they see any unauthorized activity.
 
 “We are committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for our customers and will continue to work with federal, state and local authorities in this investigation,” the chain’s chairman and CEO Robert Myers said in a statement.

Hilton says it is investigating the claims.

hiltonIn August, Visa sent confidential alerts to numerous financial institutions warning of a breach at a brick-and-mortar entity that is known to have extended from April 21, 2015 to July 27, 2015. The alerts to each bank included card numbers that were suspected of being compromised, but per Visa policy those notifications did not name the breached entity.

However, sources at five different banks say they have now determined that the common point-of-purchase for cards included in that alert had only one commonality: They were all were used at Hilton properties, including the company’s flagship Hilton locations as well as Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Suites, and the upscale Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts.

In a written statement, a Hilton spokesperson said the company is investigating the breach claims.

“Hilton Worldwide is strongly committed to protecting our customers’ credit card information,” the company said. “We have many systems in place and work with some of the top experts in the field to address data security.  Unfortunately the possibility of fraudulent credit card activity is all too common for every company in today’s marketplace.  We take any potential issue very seriously, and we are looking into this matter.”

As with other recent card breaches at major hotel chains — including Mandarin Oriental and White Lodging properties — the breach does not appear to be related to the guest reservation systems at the affected locations. Rather, sources say the fraud seems to stem from compromised point-of-sale devices inside of franchised restaurants, coffee bars and gift shops within Hilton properties.

It remains unclear how many Hilton properties may be affected by this apparent breach. Several sources in the financial industry told KrebsOnSecurity that the incident may date back to November 2014, and may still be ongoing.

A copy of the first episode of Breaking Bad worth nearly 18 gigabytes is currently being traded on various torrent sites and more leaks are expected to appear in the future.

netflixuhdWhile many average consumers can’t even play 4K content on their TV or computer, true video geeks are looking forward to every new release.

Thus far the offerings have been limited to adult content and a handful of mainstream productions. However, with the adoption of a Blu-Ray standard for Ultra High Definition video more releases will follow soon.

4K streaming releases have been available for a while already, with Netflix and Amazon being the two key vendors. These online streams are well protected against pirates.

In fact, it is believed to be impossible to break the High-Bandwidth Digital Copy Protection (HDCP) version 2.2 or higher. However, despite this copy protection the first 4K Netflix leak just appeared online.

The leak in question is the first episode of Breaking Bad and was released by the reputable group “iON.” The 2160p video file takes up 17.73 GB of space, which is roughly 50 times that of a traditional standard definition equivalent.

The image below shows the file being listed at a popular private tracker with just over a dozen people sharing it.

Breaking.Bad.S01E01.Pilot.2160p.NF.WEBRip.DTS.x264-iON

bb4k
The media info for the release shows that the episode has a bit rate of 41.3 Mbps and overall the video specs make it hard to play the file smoothly on the average computer.

At the time of writing the 4K leak is only available on private torrent trackers but it’s expected to eventually leak to public sites as well. It’s currently unknown if the release group broke HDCP 2.2 or if they found another way to capture the stream.

Leaked drafts of the 4K copy protection agreement between Sony and Netflix reveals that the streams are generally well-protected. They also include a watermark so that leaks can be traced back to the source.

“The watermark must contain sufficient information such that forensic analysis of unauthorized recorded video clips of the output video shall uniquely determine the account to which the output video was delivered,” the document reads.

It’s unclear whether the watermarks were included and if they were removed from the Breaking Bad video, but release groups are generally well-equipped to remove these type of markers.

Netflix informs TF that they are looking into the reported leak and the company will do its best to prevent similar breaches in the future.

“Piracy is a global problem. We, like others content providers, are actively working on ways to protect content featured on our site,” a Netflix spokesperson told us.

While 4K content is not going to be shared by the majority of online pirates, the first 4K leak from Netflix will certainly have Hollywood and the streaming service worried. Whether they can stop it has yet to be seen though.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,117.66000366210938,99.47000122070312,103.06999969482422,125.44000244140624,117.11000061035156,91.1500015258789,94.79000091552734,101.20999908447266,91.04000091552734,103.3000030517578,85.33000183105469,92.04000091552734,97.58000183105469,134.0,134.0

Sabre Corp. said Friday that it is investigating a ""cybersecurity incident"" but isn't sure yet what if any information was stolen.

American Airlines, which uses Sabre, says it is investigating but has found no evidence of a breach. It has hired outside experts for assistance.

The developments were first reported by Bloomberg.

Several recent high-profile cyberattacks have put corporate technology experts on edge. The attacks have included one against the federal government's personnel office and another against insurance company Anthem Inc.

Citing people familiar with the investigation, Bloomberg had reported last week that China-backed hackers breached computer systems at United Airlines in May or June. A United spokesman did not deny the report but said that customers' personal information was secure.

Sabre said in a statement Friday, ""We recently learned of a cybersecurity incident, and we are conducting an investigation into it now. At this time, we are not aware that this incident has compromised sensitive protected information, such as credit card data or personally identifiable information, but our investigation is ongoing.""

A Sabre spokeswoman did not respond when asked for additional details.

Sabre was created as the reservations arm of American Airlines, which spun off Sabre as a separate company in 2000.

American Airlines spokesman Casey Norton said the airline began investigating after the report of a breach at Sabre.

""We have brought in outside security experts whose investigation has found no evidence of a breach"" like those involving the federal Office of Personnel Management and Anthem, Norton said. ""There is no evidence that customer data has been compromised.""", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000159703315000072/0001597033-15-000072-index.htm,Risk Factors,2015-10-29 00:00:00,"Security breaches could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and our business.

The incident involved employee impersonation and fraudulent requests from an outside entity targeting the Company’s finance department. This fraud resulted in transfers of funds aggregating $46.7 million held by a Company subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong to other overseas accounts held by third parties. As soon as the Company became aware of this fraudulent activity it initiated contact with its Hong Kong subsidiary’s bank and promptly initiated legal proceedings in various foreign jurisdictions. As a result of these efforts, the Company has recovered $8.1 million of the amounts transferred. Furthermore, an additional $6.8 million of the amounts transferred are currently subject to legal injunction and reasonably expected to be recovered by the Company in due course. The Company is continuing to pursue the recovery of the remaining $31.8 million and is cooperating with U.S. federal and numerous overseas law enforcement authorities who are actively pursuing a multi-agency criminal investigation. The Company may be limited in what information it can disclose due to the ongoing investigation. The ultimate amount of the loss will depend, in part, on the Company’s success in recovering the funds. The Company may not be successful in obtaining any insurance coverage for this loss. The Company currently believes this is an isolated event and does not believe its technology systems have been compromised or that Company data has been exposed. While this matter will result in some additional near-term expenses, the Company does not expect this incident to have a material impact on its business or its ability to fund the anticipated working capital, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements of its ongoing operations. The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has conducted an independent investigation into this matter with the assistance of outside advisors. The investigation concluded on July 17, 2015. The investigation uncovered no evidence that our systems were penetrated or that any corporate information, including our financial and account information, was accessed. The investigation found no evidence of employee criminal involvement in the fraud.

United, the world’s second-largest airline, detected an incursion into its computer systems in May or early June, said several people familiar with the probe. According to three of these people, investigators working with the carrier have linked the attack to a group of China-backed hackers they say are behind several other large heists -- including the theft of security-clearance records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and medical data from health insurer Anthem Inc.
The previously unreported United breach raises the possibility that the hackers now have data on the movements of millions of Americans, adding airlines to a growing list of strategic U.S. industries and institutions that have been compromised. Among the cache of data stolen from United are manifests -- which include information on flights’ passengers, origins and destinations -- according to one person familiar with the carrier’s investigation.
It’s increasingly clear, security experts say, that China’s intelligence apparatus is amassing a vast database. Files stolen from the federal personnel office by this one China-based group could allow the hackers to identify Americans who work in defense and intelligence, including those on the payrolls of contractors. U.S. officials believe the group has links to the Chinese government, people familiar with the matter have said.
That data could be cross-referenced with stolen medical and financial records, revealing possible avenues for blackmailing or recruiting people who have security clearances. In all, the China-backed team has hacked at least 10 companies and organizations, which include other travel providers and health insurers, says security firm FireEye Inc.
Tracking Travelers
The theft of airline records potentially offers another layer of information that would allow China to chart the travel patterns of specific government or military officials.
United is one of the biggest contractors with the U.S. government among the airlines, making it a rich depository of data on the travel of American officials, military personnel and contractors. The hackers could match international flights by Chinese officials or industrialists with trips taken by U.S. personnel to the same cities at the same time, said James Lewis, a senior fellow in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
“You’re suspicious of some guy; you happen to notice that he flew to Papua New Guinea on June 23 and now you can see that the Americans have flown there on June 22 or 23,” Lewis said. “If you’re China, you’re looking for those things that will give you a better picture of what the other side is up to.”
Computer Glitches
The timing of the United breach also raises questions about whether it’s linked to computer faults that stranded thousands of the airline’s passengers in two incidents over the past couple of months. Two additional people close to the probe, who like the others asked not to be identified when discussing the investigation, say the carrier has found no connection between the hack and a July 8 systems failure that halted flights for two hours. They didn’t rule out a possible, tangential connection to an outage on June 2.
Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for Chicago-based United, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., declined to comment on the breach investigation.
Zhu Haiquan, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said in a statement: “The Chinese government and the personnel in its institutions never engage in any form of cyberattack. We firmly oppose and combat any forms of cyberattacks.”
Embedded Names
United may have gotten help identifying the breach from U.S. investigators working on the OPM hack. The China-backed hackers that cybersecurity experts have linked to that attack have embedded the name of targets in web domains, phishing e-mails and other attack infrastructure, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.
In May, the OPM investigators began drawing up a list of possible victims in the private sector and provided the companies with digital signatures that would indicate their systems had been breached. United Airlines was on that list.
Safety Concerns
In contrast to the theft of health records or financial data, the breach of airlines raises concerns of schedule disruptions or transportation gridlock. Mistakes by hackers or defenders could bring down sensitive systems that control the movement of millions of passengers annually in the U.S. and internationally.
Even if their main goal was data theft, state-sponsored hackers might seek to preserve access to airline computers for later use in more disruptive attacks, according to security experts. One of the chief tasks of the investigators in the United breach is ensuring that the hackers have no hidden backdoors that could be used to re-enter the carrier’s computer systems later, one of the people familiar with the probe said.
United spokesman Punzenberger said the company remains “vigilant in protecting against unauthorized access” and is focused on protecting its customers’ personal information.
There is evidence the hackers were in the carrier’s network for months. One web domain apparently set up for the attack -- UNITED-AIRLINES.NET -- was established in April 2014. The domain was registered by a James Rhodes, who provided an address in American Samoa.
James Rhodes is also the alias of the character War Machine in Marvel Comics’ Iron Man. Security companies tracking the OPM hackers say they often use Marvel comic book references as a way to “sign” their attack.
Targeting Pentagon
This isn’t the first time such an attack has been documented. Chinese military hackers have repeatedly targeted the U.S. Transportation Command, the Pentagon agency that coordinates defense logistics and travel.
A report last year from the Senate Armed Services Committee documented at least 50 successful hacks of the command’s contractors from June 2012 through May 2013. Hacks against the agency’s contractors have led to the theft of flight plans, shipping routes and other data from organizations working with the military, according to the report.
“The Chinese have been trying to get flight information from the government; now it looks as if they’re trying to do the same in the commercial sector,” said Tony Lawrence, a former Army sergeant and founder and chief executive officer of VOR Technology, a Columbia, Maryland-based cybersecurity firm.
It’s unclear whether United is considering notifying customers that data may have been compromised. Punzenberger said United “would abide by notification requirements if a situation warranted” it.
The airline is still trying to determine exactly which data was removed from the network, said two of the people familiar with the probe. That assessment took months in the OPM case, which was discovered in April and made public in June.
M&A Strategy
Besides passenger lists and other flight-related data, the hackers may also have taken information related to United’s mergers and acquisitions strategy, one of the people familiar with the investigation said.
Flight manifests usually contain the names and birthdates of passengers, but even if those files were taken, experts say that would be unlikely to trigger disclosure requirements in any of the 47 states with breach-notification laws.
Those disclosure laws are widely seen as outdated. The theft by hackers of corporate secrets usually goes unreported, while the stealing of customer records such as Social Security numbers and credit cards is required in most states.
“In most states, this is not going to trigger a notification,” said Srini Subramanian, state government leader for Deloitte cyber risk services.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,58.41999816894531,57.11999893188477,53.72000122070313,59.54999923706055,56.81999969482422,59.0099983215332,46.11000061035156,57.2599983215332,57.90999984741211,48.06000137329102,45.18000030517578,38.95000076293945,47.4000015258789,85.0,84.6

The hacker gained access to general customer information through the company’s website by posing as a “guest” customer checking an order, meaning they weren’t registered on the site. The hacker was able to get information including addresses, phone numbers and last four digits of a credit or debit card of other customers, Hanesbrands spokesman Matt Hall said.
Hall said affected customers bought items online or by telephone and used the “guest” option. Retail stores were not affected, he said.
The data was exposed the last week of June and into early July, Hall said.
“They were able to manipulate the system like they were a customer,” Hall said. “They could check order status using a screen grab.
Customers are being notified by email or mail.
He said data for registered user account information, such as log-in name and passwords, is kept in a separate database and was not viewable.
However, Hall said registered users’ order status information “could have been viewed, so there are registered users among the 900,000 customers.”
“While we don't keep full credit card numbers, we do keep email addresses, but they were not viewable or accessible via the order status function.”
Hall said the breach involved “information (that) is readily available in the public domain, such as on packaging labels or a restaurant receipt. There was no visibility to email addresses or full credit-card numbers.”
Hall said the hackers weren’t able to enter corporate software systems. He also said Hanesbrands was notified by the hacker “to let us know that it had been done.”
“We brought in cybersecurity personnel to determine if the vulnerability was there and the data was viewable, and it was,” Hall said.
The company’s investigation has not determined a motive for the breach, Hall said.
“We want to be up front with our customers and let them know what happened, that we take this seriously and are thankful it doesn’t pose a major risk to customers’ financial information,” Hall said.
Hall said that “because of the benign nature and public availability of most of the information, our security experts tell us that there is no credible identity or credit risk to customers.
“Customers can contact our customer service center if they have concerns, which was communicated to them in the emails/letters.”
The guest order status link on the company website has been repaired, but has not been re-activated.
“We’re not sure that we will activate it,” Hall said. “If a customer doesn’t want to register on the website, they can call to get order status.”
Direct-to-consumer sales – including retail stores and online – is one of four revenue segments that Hanesbrands discloses quarterly. The company releases its second-quarter earnings report after the market closes today.
For the first quarter, direct to consumer sales were $81.5 million, representing 6.7 percent of all sales.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,33.15999984741211,30.26000022888184,28.479999542236328,27.60000038146973,31.25,28.8799991607666,29.6200008392334,28.489999771118164,28.29999923706055,29.53000068664551,27.03000068664551,25.81999969482422,25.649999618530273,38.0,38.0

Dear Valued Customer,
Here at AeroGrow International, Inc., we take the security of our customers’ information seriously. Unfortunately, like
many companies in today’s global digital economy, we recently received information suggesting that we may have
experienced a data compromise. We hired cybersecurity specialists to investigate the incident. As a result of this
investigation, we determined on June 10, 2015, that a hacker used malicious software (malware) to infiltrate our on-line
servers, which are hosted by a leading service provider. Within days of being notified of the hacking event, the cause of
the compromise had been eradicated.
However, as a result of this unauthorized event some information linked to credit cards may have been acquired. This
information may include name, address, payment card account number, expiration date, and CCV/CVV number.
AeroGrow does not collect other personal information about its customers, such as Social Security number, personal
identification number (PIN), driver’s license number, or financial account information, and as a result, none of this type of
personal information was at risk of being compromised.
Of course we regret that this malicious hacking event occurred, but we want you to know a few important things:
• It is safe to shop at AeroGarden.com. The malware used to capture personal information has been eliminated.
• Order information that you provided during the period of October 15, 2014 – June 10, 2015 may have been acquired.
If your credit card information was compromised, it does not mean you are a victim of fraud. If you suspect that your
credit card was used fraudulently, promptly notify the credit card company.
• We do not store, and have never stored, your credit card information on any of our systems. Any information
obtained was captured by the malware in the fraction of a second between data entry and the transmission to our
credit card processing company.
• As noted above, we do not collect any PIN information. As a result, even if someone gained access to your card
information, without your PIN they cannot visit an ATM with a fraudulent debit card and withdraw cash.
• Out of an abundance of caution and at no cost to you, we are offering you free access to ProtectMyID Elite, an
identity protection product provided by Experian, a leading national credit bureau. Full details of this program are
provided on page 2.
I am personally troubled and offended by this criminal activity. As a result, we have alerted law enforcement authorities in
an effort to help eradicate this type of crime and to help protect anyone who uses a credit card for shopping. In addition,
on page 2 you will find a detailed list of strategies on how best to protect credit card information in today’s digital
economy.
If you have any questions about this situation, our Customer Service team is available toll-free at 1-866-348-1808 from
8 am - 5 pm Mountain Time, Monday - Friday.
I want to sincerely apologize for this incident, and I regret any inconvenience it may have caused you. As we’ve all read
in the news in the past few years, many of us have been impacted by security breaches at major retailers and institutions.
In fact, I was personally affected by one of those large breaches, so I’ve taken an emotional and personal interest in this
topic. I want to assure you that we take this criminal act very seriously and have addressed it thoroughly.
Thank you for your continued confidence and support.

While, in the case with Infosys, ICICI, the official bank of the company had to refund the amounts, the incident highlights some of the broader security challenges facing banks today.

Experts believe that the banking sector is facing heightened challenge of increased phishing attacks, skimming of cards (as in the case with Infosys) APTs, security skills shortage and most importantly an inability to detect threats.

Banks should gear up

According to some, the online security measures that are currently in place in most public and private sector banks are not adequate to counter emerging threats – more so because most banks are still relying on redundant security measures.

For example in Infosys’ case alone, which the Bank blames as card skimming, security experts believe such frauds happen because banks continue to ask simplistic questions on customer’s date of birth, address, mother’s maiden name, name of spouse, and other general information that are publicly available on Facebook, LinkedIn and job search portals. Undoubtedly fraudsters have easy access to such information.

R. K. Chhattani, IT evangelist and DGM at UCO Bank states that the human risk is a big problem for Indian financial institutions. In an interview with CXOtoday he stated, banks need to start proactively educating their employees and customers to prevent cyber threats from persisting.

As in case of Infosys, an ICICI bank official reported that the impacted customers did not have enhanced security enabled EMV chip debit cards. Banks should work on improving awareness of the different threats that currently exist including e-mail fraud, phishing and malware and ensure that customer cards are updated.

Su Gim Goh, security advisor, F-Secure in a recent report also mentions the importance of special training sessions for employees and customers - on tackling security threats  to create awareness at every level.

Cultivating a risk culture

Traditionally, banks in emerging markets have paid little attention to cultivating a risk culture, where employees are motivated to speak on new risks. Sanjay Deshpande, CEO & Co-Founder, Uniken notes that limited understanding of the risks is proving to be harmful for the banks. As banks are required to manage massive data, CISOs and IT managers are compelled to develop a risk appetite.

He also states while majority of the banks are largely dependent on incidents being reported by their customers and employees, the need of the hour however is a real time incident management mechanism.

Banks should essentially align internal policies, procedures and deploy technology safeguards for protecting sensitive personal information – and make risk management a key part of boardroom discussion.

CISOs role redefined

The current nature of threats also puts focus on the CISOs role in banking. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already stated that every bank needs a mandatory CISO position to be accountable for the risks. 

The CISOs must learn lessons from the past to gear up for the future, says Sameer Ratolikar, CISO, Axis Bank. “CISOs also need to play a leadership role in building the skills necessary for leveraging new technologies and come up risk management strategy in order to address the complex scenario,” he says.

He believes CISOs also need to collaborate with peers and industry experts through networking and information sharing to learn the methods of thwarting the most sophisticated threats.", ,,ND,,,, ,,,,,,,7.8125,7.739999771118164,8.729999542236326,8.845000267028809,8.9399995803833,8.734999656677246,8.114999771118164,8.125,8.104999542236326,8.979999542236328,9.085000038146973,9.329999923706056,9.039999961853027,537.5,506.3852666666667

Credit card fraud can be stopped. Here's how

For some people, nothing is more valuable than that morning cup of coffee, and Starbucks makes it ridiculously easy to grab fast on-the-go with gift cards, mobile apps and probably even more digital commerce options on the way.

But with such privilege comes a cost, and it's much more than just an overpriced caramel macchiato.

Turns out the only thing easier than paying with a Starbucks app is hacking into one, based on a scoop by consumer advocate blogger Bob Sullivan on Tuesday.

""Criminals are using Starbucks accounts to access consumers' linked credit cards,"" Sullivan wrote. ""Taking advantage of the Starbucks auto-reload function, they can steal hundreds of dollars in a matter of minutes.""

ZDNet reached out to Starbucks for comment. The coffee giant has not commented publicly yet on the matter.

Until the Seattle-founded chain announces some sort of resolution, Sullivan advised customers to turn off the auto-reload function at the very least.

Jonathan Sander, a strategy officer at research firm STEALTHbits Technologies, acknowledged no one knows exactly how hackers are stealing cash through Starbucks cards, but there is one obvious culprit: weak passwords.

""A word to the wise is that anywhere you have your credit card saved you should treat it like it's a locker where you keep your wallet,"" Sander added.

Starbucks has suffered a few technical mishaps in recent memory -- most recently a computer glitch in April affecting its point-of-sale system at locations nationwide.

The only pieces of good news to be gleaned from that event were possibly some free lattes and the promise no customer data was compromised.

Nevertheless, the latest potential breach puts a dent in Starbucks's ongoing strategy as a tech-friendly and increasingly mobile-first brand.

Brendan Rizzo, technical director for HP Security Voltage, suggested this week's Starbucks incident serves as a reminder to the responsibility that companies have in protecting customer data.

That data, Rizzo explained, includes names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers, just to start. From there, he continued, hackers could exploit the data from simply selling it off to much more damaging spear-fishing attacks and identity theft.

Rizzo stressed, ""Beyond the threat to customers' sensitive data, companies need to be concerned with the impact such an event can have on their reputation and, ultimately, on their bottom line.""", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,49.5,52.68999862670898,54.56999969482422,56.27000045776367,55.36999893188477,60.06999969482422,62.18000030517578,61.86999893188477,57.81999969482422,55.13999938964844,57.52000045776367,60.9000015258789,57.4900016784668,60.0,60.0

DENTON, Texas - (BUSINESS WIRE) - May 4, 2015 -

Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. is currently investigating reports of unusual activity involving payment cards used at some of our U.S. Sally Beauty stores. Since learning of these reports, we have been working with law enforcement and our credit card processor and have launched a comprehensive investigation with the help of a leading third-party forensics expert to aggressively gather facts while working to ensure our customers are protected. Until this investigation is completed, it is difficult to determine with certainty the scope or nature of any potential incident, but we will continue to work vigilantly to address any potential issues that may affect our customers.

Consistent with our ""Love it or Return It"" policy, customer confidence and security remain our priority. As a result, we encourage any customer who is concerned about the security of their payment cards to call our Customer Service Hotline at 1-866-234-9442, so that we can assist them in addressing any potential concerns. Information will also be available on sallybeautyholdings.com. Sally Beauty will, as appropriate, provide updates as we learn more from our investigation.",http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000110465915033408/a15-10701_1ex99d1.htm,2015-05-04 00:00:00,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000110465915056953/0001104659-15-056953-index.htm,Footnotes | MDA,2015-08-06 00:00:00,"Data Security Incidents
 
In March 2014, the Company disclosed that it had experienced a data security incident (the “2014 data security incident”). In May 2015, the Company disclosed that it had experienced a second illegal intrusion into its payment card systems (the “2015 data security incident” and, together with the 2014 data security incident, the “data security incidents”). The costs that the Company has incurred to date in connection with the data security incidents primarily include professional advisory fees and legal costs and expenses relating to investigating and remediating the data security incidents. For the nine months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect expenses of $5.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, relating to the data security incidents. These amounts include an accrued liability of approximately $2.9 million related to potential litigation costs and expenses associated with the 2014 data security incident recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2015.
 
We expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the data security incidents in future periods. These costs may result from potential liabilities to payment card networks, governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation and legal and other fees necessary to defend against any potential liabilities or claims, and further investigatory and remediation costs. Please see “Risk Factors — We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems,” “Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results” and “We experienced a data security incident and are not yet able to determine the full extent or scope of the potential liabilities relating to this data security incident” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.",39900000,600000.0,,,,,,30.56999969482422,31.53000068664551,30.6200008392334,30.170000076293945,26.209999084472656,23.88999938964844,23.6299991607666,25.649999618530273,27.85000038146973,26.63999938964844,31.5,32.549999237060554,31.6200008392334,33.0,33.25

Presumably large amounts of cash are spent purchasing fuel from such accounts, and that’s why no alarm was raised as €4.6 million was transferred from the account.Whether, of course, large payments for fuel is often made via Chinese banks is information that I’m not privy too – but apparently that’s where at a least one bank transfer did end up going.ryanair-600Who was behind the assault on Ryanair’s bank account is currently a matter of pure speculation. Just because a Chinese bank was involved does not necessarily mean that Chinese criminals were behind the attack.Additionally, no details of how the hack was perpetrated have been made public, although in a statement the airline says that it has taken steps to prevent a reoccurrence:“Ryanair confirms that it has investigated a fraudulent electronic transfer via a Chinese bank last week. The airline has been working with its banks and the relevant authorities and understands that the funds – less than $5 million – have now been frozen. The airline expects these funds to be repaid shortly, and has taken steps to ensure that this type of transfer cannot recur.”Earlier this month, IBM security researchers published details of a criminal campaign dubbed “Dyre Wolf” that successfully stole more than $1 million from targeted businesses. In that campaign, hackers infected workers’ computers with malware and tricked them into ringing a live phone operator (working for the gang) who could socially engineer credentials and wire large sums of money out of the business’s account.Although a fairly crude technique, it does successfully circumvent commonly-used defences such as two-factor authentication.Of course, it’s not known if this was the technique used by the criminals who attacked Ryanair.Personally I think it’s a shame that Ryanair hasn’t been able shed more light on the details of how the hack might have occurred, or what steps it might have taken to prevent it from happening again. After all, that would no doubt be information which could prove useful to other organisations which wish to protect themselves from similar criminal activity.After all, if the airline has been able to fix the problem so quickly it would presumably be simple for other organisations to make sure that they were taking similar precautions or proactive steps to avoid falling to the same fate.Ryanair became aware of the fraud on Friday, and Dublin’s Criminal Assets Bureau has been working with its counterparts in Asia to try to recover the money.", ,,ND,,,,5000000,,,,,,,68.30769348144531,69.74359130859375,72.88204956054688,74.67692565917969,75.83589935302734,80.37948608398438,80.54000091552734,77.5999984741211,87.31999969482422,77.48999786376953,83.16999816894531,84.05999755859375,81.70999908447266,78.9745,78.9745

“As part of Hyatt Gold Passport’s routine monitoring of member account activity, we found a small number of accounts were accessed by an unauthorized individual utilizing member usernames and passwords,” the hotel chain explained in a letter to program members.

“We have no reason to believe, at this time, the login information was obtained through Hyatt Gold Passport, and we continue to analyze and monitor our systems. We have reached out to members we know have been affected to resolve any concerns.”

The letter goes on to say that in order to “enhance account security” passwords connected to a given username have been reset. This means that when any of the more than 18 million members access their account with a username rather than their account number, they’ll be prompted to reset their password.

“We strongly recommend that you reset your username and password to a unique combination not used elsewhere. You will not be able to access your account online until you change your password.”

Those with questions are encouraged to call 800.228.3360, or their local Hyatt.

Update:

In a statement, Trey Ford, Global Security Strategist for Rapid7, pointed out that Hyatt did the right thing when it comes to this type of disclosure. Compared to the other disclosures from organizations that have experienced a security incident this year, Hyatt's is simple and honest.

""Transparency is one of the most effective ways to build trust with customers. Hyatt’s client notification on the unauthorized access of Hyatt Gold Passport accounts wasn’t just good for establishing trust – they are educating and building loyalty. The company explained what happened, how they found the issue, and what steps customers should take to protect themselves.

""Hyatt took action without being alarmist or cryptic, and were instead straightforward and meaningful.

The video-streaming site has notified its account holders that they should change theirs passwords. Twitch has updated its blog sharing information about the incident, and it is also sending out an email that contains the same warning. The company is warning that the hackers may have had access to personal account information. Twitch is a hugely popular website where people can broadcast live video of themselves playing games. More than a million people do exactly that, and more than 65 million load up the site each month to view content.

Here is Twitch’s official statement on the matter:

We are writing to let you know that there may have been unauthorized access to some Twitch user account information.

For your protection, we have expired passwords and stream keys and have disconnected accounts from Twitter and YouTube. As a result, you will be prompted to create a new password the next time you attempt to log into your Twitch account.

We also recommend that you change your password at any website where you use the same or a similar password. We will communicate directly with affected users with additional details.
The company has since sent out an email only to people it thinks were affected by the attack. We got our hands on that text (thanks to Twitter users Chris Seymour and Oirya). Check out the relevant info (emphasis added):

We are writing to let you know that there may have been unauthorized access to some of your Twitch user account information, including possibly your Twitch username and associated email address, your password, the last IP address you logged in from, limited credit card information (card type, truncated card number and expiration date), and any of the following if you provided it to us: first and last name, phone number, address, and date of birth.

PLEASE NOTE: Twitch does not store or process full credit or debit card information, so your card number is safe.

While we store passwords in a cryptographically protected form, we believe it’s possible that your password could have been captured in clear text by malicious code when you logged into our site on March 3rd.
We’ve asked for more information, but the company has declined to comment on what personal information is at risk. It also did not say whether credit-card information — used for subscribing to various channels or Twitch turbo — was accessed.

Last week, Twitch went down for several hours, but the company has told us that particular outage was not the result of the attack it is talking about today. A spokesperson specifically referred to it as an “internal tech issue” before the company shared news of the apparently separate security incident.

The grocery chain says it is investigating “a potential data security incident involving an unauthorized intrusion targeting limited customer payment card data.”

ngrocerIn response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity about a possible security breach, Lakewood, Colo. based Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage Inc. said it has hired a third-party data forensics firm, and that law enforcement is investigating the matter.

Natural Grocers emphasized that it “has received no reports of any fraudulent use of payment cards from any customer, credit card brand or financial institution.”

“In addition, there is no evidence that PIN numbers or card verification codes were accessed,” the company’s statement continued. “Finally, no personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses or Social Security numbers, was involved, as the company does not collect that data as part of its payment processing system.”

Perhaps they aren’t reporting the fraud to Natural Grocer, but banking sources have told this author about a pattern of card fraud indicating cards stolen from the retailer are already on sale in the cybercrime underground.

According to a source with inside knowledge of the breach, the attackers broke in just before Christmas 2014, by attacking weaknesses in the company’s database servers. From there, the attackers moved laterally with Natural Grocers’ internal network, eventually planting card-snooping malware on point-of-sale systems.

Natural Grocers said that while its investigation is ongoing, the company has accelerated plans to upgrade the point-of-sale system in all of its store locations with a new PCI-compliant system that provides point-to-point encryption and new PIN pads that accept secure “chip and PIN” cards.

“These upgrades provide multiple layers of protection for cardholder data,” Natural Grocer’s emailed statement concludes. “The company is in the process of installing this new system at all 93 Natural Grocers stores in 15 states. The company takes data security very seriously and is committed to protecting its customers’ information. This is all the information the company is able to provide at this time, as the investigation into the incident is ongoing.”", ,,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774916024251/0001437749-16-024251-index.htm,Footnotes | Legal Proceedings,2016-01-28 00:00:00,"In Bernhard Engl v.

The intruders appear to have used a technique known as “social engineering” – which relies on manipulating people into volunteering confidential information – to trick an IT support agent into handing over an employee’s confidential details that were then used to gain access to Rogers’ internal records.

Patricia Trott, a spokeswoman for the Toronto-based Internet and phone provider, said a “third party” accessed a “single e-mail address of one of our enterprise sales employees, who managed a small number of medium business accounts.”

The breach occurred last week, she said in a statement Monday, and was due to “human error (not system error).”

Late Sunday afternoon an anonymous Twitter user using the handle @TeamHans_ posted a link to a .zip file containing copies of dozens of contracts for telecommunications services as well as e-mail correspondence from the Rogers sales employee.

The contracts appear to relate to between 50 and 70 medium-sized businesses that were part of the portfolio managed by the employee whose e-mail account was accessed.

The contracts do not appear to contain payment or password information but they do indicate details such as the number of data or phone lines purchased as well as the amount spent by the business customers.

“The third party was able to access a small number of business agreements managed by this employee. The agreements include the business name, business address, business phone number and pricing details. They do not contain personal or financial information,” Ms. Trott said in the statement. “The third party did not have access to any information on our retail customers (consumer accounts).”

“As soon as we discovered the situation we took all the necessary steps to secure our systems,” she said, adding that the company is “working with the police” and has contacted the affected customers.

“As a precaution, we’ve put additional security procedures in place for our business customers. We take the privacy and security of our customers’ information very seriously and we will continue to review our policies and procedures.”

The website Databreaches.net first reported the breach on Sunday evening. The website said it conducted an interview with the individuals behind the @TeamHans_ Twitter account who explained how they called Rogers IT support and convinced the agent to give them the sales employee’s details.

According to the Databreaches story, those behind @TeamHans_ – who claim not to be from Canada – said they demanded Rogers give them 70 bitcoins in exchange for not revealing the breach or sharing the information publicly.

The demand for the virtual currency is also revealed in one of the e-mails disclosed in the data dump, which outlines steps Rogers was taking to address the breach of the employee’s account and an apparent threat to himself and his family. The intruders told Databreaches they did not make such a threat.

A report last week from Silicon Valley security firm FireEye Inc. outlined how corporations are often unprepared to counter data breaches.

Relevant to the Rogers breach, the report found organizations are often vulnerable to mistakes by their own people. More than three-quarters of “phishing” e-mails – messages meant to fool recipients into sharing passwords and login information to access protected servers – came from hackers impersonating the company’s information technology department or suppliers of anti-virus software in 2014, almost double the level the previous year, the report said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,35.20000076293945,33.830001831054695,35.36999893188477,34.240001678466804,35.54999923706055,35.080001831054695,33.080001831054695,34.360000610351555,39.59000015258789,38.459999084472656,34.459999084472656,34.93000030517578,37.81999969482422,47.0,47.0

Investigators are still determining the extent of the incursion, which was discovered last week, and Anthem said it is likely that “tens of millions” of records were stolen. The health insurer said the breach exposed names, birthdays, addresses and Social Security numbers but doesn’t appear to involve medical information or financial details such as credit-card or bank-account numbers, nor are there signs the data are being sold on the black market.

Anthem, which offers Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in California, New York and other states, said it doesn’t know precisely how many people may be affected. So far, it appears that the attack detected last week is the only breach of Anthem’s systems, and it isn’t yet clear how the hackers were able to obtain the identification information needed to access the database said Thomas Miller, the insurer’s chief information officer.

The insurer said it would reach out to everyone whose information was stored in the hacked database with a letter and, where possible, email. It is also setting up an informational website and will offer to provide a credit-monitoring service.

Its decision to reveal the attack days after its discovery, even as the investigation is getting under way, may signal a changing attitude among corporate executives about rapid disclosures in the wake of breaches of companies including Target Corp. , Home Depot Inc. and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

Anthem detected the breach itself, which puts it in the minority among companies subject to such attacks, and “organizations don’t typically provide notification this early on,” said David Damato, managing director at FireEye Inc., owner of cybersecurity unit Mandiant, which Anthem has hired to investigate.

When hackers intruded on servers at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. this summer, the incident was reported by media outlets weeks after the bank had learned there was an issue. The bank has said previously that only contact information was compromised and it has seen no fraud associated with the event.

Anthem’s Mr. Miller said the company wanted “to share the information as soon as possible.” Federal law requires health-care companies to inform consumers and regulators when they suffer a data breach involving personally identifiable information, but they have as many as 60 days after the discovery of an attack to report it.

Anthem, based in Indianapolis and formerly known as WellPoint, covers around 37.5 million people. The hacked database included information for some current and former customers as well as its own employees; it also held medical and financial details, but the insurer said those details don’t appear to be included in the data stolen by the hackers.

The Anthem incident could rank among the largest of recent attacks. The J.P. Morgan breach compromised contact information for about 76 million households. Home Depot has said 56 million credit-card accounts were compromised, and 53 million customer email addresses stolen. Target’s cyberattack affected 40 million payment cards. Both retailers offered credit monitoring after the fact and banks typically reimburse consumers for fraudulent charges resulting from a data breach.

Daniel Nutkis, chief executive of the Health Information Trust Alliance, a nonprofit that helps health-care companies with computer security, said the largest previously known hacker theft from a health-care company was last year’s intrusion at hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc., which involved records on 4.5 million consumers. In that case, the company said it regretted the breach and pointed to a group originating from China for the attack. Much of the sector remains vulnerable, and few have the ability to detect and respond to an attack as Anthem has, he said, though the alliance has already started warning other health-care companies about what happened to the big insurer.

Mr. Damato, of FireEye, said the firm has seen more cyberattacks specifically targeting health-care concerns. Health companies often hold rich stores of consumer data, including sensitive details of people’s prescriptions, care and illnesses.

He said the Anthem attack was “sophisticated” and used techniques that appeared to have been customized, rather than broadly available tools, and were “very advanced.” Investigators haven’t yet concluded who was behind the Anthem breach. Community Health Systems, for one, said it believed its incursion originated in China.

Anthem’s Mr. Miller said the first sign of the attack came in the middle of last week, when a systems administrator noticed that a database query was being run using his identifier code although he hadn’t initiated it. Anthem quickly determined that an attack had occurred, he said, informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and hired Mandiant.

Investigators tracked the hacked data to an outside Web-storage service and were able to freeze it there, but it isn’t yet clear if the hackers were able to earlier remove it to another location, Mr. Miller said. The Web storage service used by the hackers, which Mr. Miller declined to name, was one that is commonly used by U.S. companies, which may have made the initial data theft harder to detect.

A spokesman for the FBI said the agency is “aware of the Anthem intrusion and is investigating the matter” and praised the insurer for its “initial response in promptly notifying the FBI after observing suspicious network activity.”

In the wake of the attack, Anthem has reset the passwords of all employees with higher-level access to its data systems, and has blocked all access that involves only one password, Mr. Miller said.

Anthem said it doesn’t expect the incident to affect its 2015 financial outlook, “primarily as a result of normal contingency planning and preparation.”", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1156039/000115603915000003/0001156039-15-000003-index.htm,Footnotes | Risk Factors | Legal Proceedings,2015-02-24 00:00:00,"An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member or employee information, including by cyber attack or other security breach, could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
As part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential member and employee information. We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential member and provider information, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and numerous state laws governing personal information.

In February 2015, we reported the discovery that certain of our information technology systems had been the target of an external cyber attack, as more fully described under Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies - Data Breach,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are in the process of determining the extent of this cyber attack; however, at this time we believe that personal information of many of our current and former members and employees was obtained in the cyber attack. We have incurred expenses to investigate and remediate this matter and expect to continue to incur expenses of this nature in the foreseeable future. Although we are unable to quantify the ultimate magnitude of such expenses at this time, they may be significant. In addition, we are currently responding to a number of governmental inquiries and are subject to purported class action lawsuits and other claims relating to the cyber attack, and in the future we may be subject to additional litigation and governmental investigations. These investigations and claims could divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in reputational damage and have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we have contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities of this nature, these may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities.

The compromise follows a similar incident at United Airlines that came to light in late December, when the company notified several thousand of its MileagePlus members that intruders accessed their frequent flier accounts (see: Fraudsters Target United Frequent Fliers). For approximately three dozen accounts, the intruders were able to make a mileage transaction, such as booking a ticket, United said.

The Security Implications
Breaches involving airlines are worrisome because of the implications of fraudsters booking airline tickets under the guise of frequent fliers, says Shirley Inscoe, an analyst at the consultancy Aite Group.

""Frequent fliers are often exempted from the same level of security scrutiny in airports as other passengers,"" she says. ""If the fraudster booked the ticket in the name of the frequent flier, and has identity documents that can pass airport scrutiny, we could see another round of terrorist attacks involving airplanes.""

The fact that both American Airlines and United were targeted shows the value fraudsters see in mileage points, which are a quasi-currency, says fraud expert Tom Wills, director of consulting firm Ontrack Advisory. ""They're less valuable than hard cash, but only slightly less because airline trips are valuable to a lot of people, and they're expensive to buy.""

In addition, frequent flier accounts aren't subject to PCI compliance, money laundering scrutiny or mandatory two-factor authentication, Wills says. ""That makes it that much easier for the fraudsters to work with them.""

The similarity of two frequent flier program attacks makes it appear that the same or related groups may have been involved, Wills adds.

Need for Better Authentication
The re-use of usernames and passwords across multiple websites contributes to a higher rate of fraud, says Al Pascual, director of fraud and security at Javelin Strategy and Research. ""To address this trend, businesses can implement two-factor authentication,"" he says.

Given the fact that a majority of consumers use the same online credentials for multiple websites, it is foolish for airlines not to assume their customer credentials have been compromised in all of the recent data breaches, Inscoe at Aite Group says. ""They should use multi-factor authentication,"" she says. ""While it is a bit more complicated and costly, it is worthwhile to protect an asset frequent fliers appreciate and often take steps to accumulate.""

In addition, organizations can bolster their password policies, such as by requiring frequent password changes as well as encouraging the use of password managers, Pascual says.

Airlines and other retailers can also consider other alternatives to common username and password account access, such as through biometric authentication, which will soon be a standard feature on smart phones, Wills says. ""This takes away the usability concerns about passwords,"" he says. ""Although for robust security, biometric access has to be used together with other security layers,"" including encryption of account information and behavioral analytics, Wills explains.

Customers Notified
American Airlines says it's notifying affected customers and has locked the accounts that may have been accessed without their authorization.

The airline says it's working with U.S. federal law enforcement to investigate the matter. Although the affected accounts do not contain Social Security numbers or full payment card information, impacted customers are being offered free credit monitoring services for one year.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,50.4000015258789,48.38999938964844,49.22000122070313,47.790000915527344,48.4900016784668,40.709999084472656,42.41999816894531,42.66999816894531,42.290000915527344,43.40999984741211,43.45000076293945,41.77000045776367,40.099998474121094,21.531999999999996,40.30555882352942

The bank last week terminated Galen Marsh, who worked at a Midtown Manhattan branch of Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said.

Robert Gottlieb, Mr. Marsh’s attorney, said his client had acknowledged obtaining the account information and confirmed that he was fired. But Mr. Gottlieb said Mr. Marsh didn’t post the data online, and wasn’t seeking to sell it.

Morgan Stanley said its employee downloaded information on about 10% of its wealth-management clients, totaling about 350,000. The bank said that on Dec. 27 it discovered data related to about 900 of its client accounts during a routine review of public websites known to traffic in such information. The data, which included account names and numbers, states of residence and asset values, appeared on the Internet “briefly,” the firm said Monday in a statement.

The bank said no clients were financially harmed. Morgan Stanley is still investigating how Mr. Marsh was able to obtain the information on such a wide swath of its clients, according to a person familiar with the matter.

“It is important to note that 90% of our clients are unaffected and, for those impacted, there is no evidence that critical data such as Social Security numbers or account passwords were exposed or taken,” Gregory Fleming, president of Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management arm, wrote in a memo to his division’s employees reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Data security has become a growing concern for companies in the wake of several high-profile cyberattacks last year. In one of the most sweeping breaches of a financial institution, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said about 76 million households were affected by a cybersecurity attack on the bank last summer.

Mr. Marsh “already has suffered the severe consequence of his actions in being terminated,” Mr. Gottlieb said. “To be clear: Mr. Marsh did not sell nor ever intended to sell any account information. He did not post the information online. He did not share any account information with anyone. He did not use it for any financial gain. He is devastated by what has occurred and is extremely sorry for his conduct.”

The bank referred the situation to law-enforcement and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulatory organization.

Although the stolen data likely can’t give potential thieves enough information to create a duplicate identity, it can provide an important first step, says Darren Hayes, assistant professor and director of cybersecurity at Pace University in New York.

FROM THE ARCHIVES

When contact information for 76 million J.P. Morgan Chase customers was stolen last year, a big risk was that fraudsters would seek to use that data to trick account holders into sharing more personal information. The WSJ’s Total Return personal-finance blog in October offered advice on what to guard against.

“We are today still focused on Social Security numbers, but an email address and a phone number can provide a gateway to getting more information about you and it is valuable information to identify individuals with big bank accounts,” he said in a telephone interview.

Almost all wealth-management clients at major Wall Street firms keep balances of at least six figures and many maintain millions of dollars in their accounts.

J. Paul Haynes, CEO of cybersecurity firm eSentire Inc., said in some ways the threat is greater for wealth-management clients when their accounts are compromised because transactions often are done through email requests that sometimes go unchecked.

The amount of money at stake is often considerably larger in brokerage accounts versus most credit cards.

“You are actually dealing with a high degree of human threat versus entirely automated,” Mr. Haynes said.

Morgan Stanley discovered the client data on Pastebin, an open file-sharing website that has attracted attention in recent months for its role as a depository for leaks of confidential information, including the hacking at Sony Pictures Entertainment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Pastebin officials had no immediate comment.

Mr. Marsh joined Morgan Stanley in 2008 and had been promoted from trainee less than a year ago. When confronted by company officials on the data breach, Mr. Marsh told the firm he had downloaded the information, a violation of firm policy, but denied posting it online, people familiar with the matter said.

Morgan Stanley’s large wealth-management business, which includes a brokerage force of 16,162, has been a source of strength for the firm, and a key driver enabling it to outperform many of its peers last year. Revenue in that division climbed 8.7% to $3.79 billion in the third quarter.

“While the situation is disappointing, it is always difficult to prevent harm caused by those willing to steal,” Mr. Fleming wrote in his memo.

The epic breach of the film studio, perpetrated by the so-called Guardians of Peace, saw masses of emails from the company’s top brass leak online and Forbes has now uncovered details of yet another successful attack on the firm, this time in Germany.

Sony has sent various US publications letters asking them to delete the stolen data and not report on it. Forbes has decided to publish what is in the public interest, hence our stories on Sony’s attempts to fight piracy by influencing other companies, a government investigation into “special influence” in China and weaknesses in security at the film giant that has left citizens’ data exposed.

An email from Courtney Schaberg, VP of legal compliance at Sony Pictures, to general counsel Leah Weil, dated 16 January 2014, reported a compromise of the Sonypictures.de site. The website was swiftly taken down after it emerged the site had been hacked to serve up malware to visitors. Schaberg also expressed concern that email addresses and birthdates for 47,740 individuals who signed up to the site’s newsletter had been accessed by the attacker.

On Friday 17 January 2014, Schaberg told Weil that it was unclear whether personal information had been taken as an investigation by a third party would not start until the following Monday, but it was unlikely Sony would disclose the breach publicly. “At this point, if PI [personal information] was accessed, it does not look like there would be a breach notification obligation to inform individuals. We should, however, inform our data protection officer in Germany, with whom we work on a regular basis. We will likely inform him of the incident tomorrow and will plan to work with him to develop an investigation strategy for next week,” the email read.

In the same email, Schaberg talks about the PR response of Sony. The strategy was simple: don’t talk about the attack. One user, who was likely warned about malware on the site by their browser, made a comment about the issue on the local Facebook page, Schaberg noted. “The strategy at this point is not to remove the comment and not to comment ourselves,” she added. Forbes could not find such a comment on the Sony Pictures Germany page.

The following day, Schaberg noted Sony had slightly changed tack on to whom it would divulge information on the breach. “When we have more facts, we will evaluate how to notify the German DPO, which we determined not to do today given (i) that we do not yet know if there was PI involved, (ii) the limited types of PI potentially involved, and (iii) the fact that the PI was stored on a server separate from the infected server.  With additional facts, we will also determine whether to notify individuals and/or the Berlin DPA,” her email read.

Sony declined to comment on the breach. But it would not have been compelled to disclose the breach to the authorities in Germany. It’s only necessary to disclose where certain kinds of sensitive data, such as banking or healthcare information, is exposed, according to a spokesperson for the local data protection officer in Berlin said. If a breach only leaks email addresses and birthdates no one has to know, he added, and only government bodies have to notify regulators regardless of what kind of data has been compromised.

To disclose publicly, Sony would have had to go to their local data protection officer in Berlin and would then have been told if they needed to inform those affected. The spokesperson said the regulator had not received a disclosure notice from Sony Pictures. Forbes could find no further emails on the matter after 18 January 2014.

But the leaks continue to reveal breaches of Sony’s defences. Previously reported leaks have already uncovered a hack from February that exposed data of 749 “individuals associated with theaters in Brazil”, which Sony also decided not to disclose, as well as some notable gaps in Sony Pictures’ security that meant it was blind to the status of 17 per cent of devices on one of its networks.


To web security expert and Microsoft MSFT -0.56% Most Valuable Professional Troy Hunt, Sony should have disclosed such successful attacks regardless of local data protection laws. “The only thing that would surprise me is if there weren’t many more of these that they both know about and have never identified,” Hunt told Forbes.

“It’s concerning though to see an attitude which sought to keep information from individuals about their personal data having been compromised. In fact, the whole episode appears to be very focused around keeping the incident quiet rather than looking after the best interests of their customers. Whilst legislation differs from country to country on what must be publicly disclosed and when customers should be notified of a breach, the ethics of hiding information like this are pretty consistent across the globe.”", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313838/000090342315000476/0000903423-15-000476-index.htm,Footnotes | Legal Proceedings,2015-08-05 00:00:00,"In the fall of 2014, Sony Corporation’s U.S. subsidiary, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

Technicians are making headway in repairing damage caused by the attack and expect to have the email systems back online Monday, said one of the people, who were not authorized to publicly discuss efforts to deal with the attack.

Sony executives have declined to comment on the scope of the attack, though emails have been bouncing back with messages asking senders to call employees because the system was ""experiencing a disruption.""

A representative with FireEye declined comment.

Mandiant is an incident response firm that helps victims of breaches identify the extent of attacks, clean up networks and restore systems.

The technology news website Re/code reported on Friday that Sony was investigating to determine whether hackers working on behalf of North Korea might be responsible for the attack, possibly in retribution for the studio's backing of the film ""The Interview,"" which is to be released on Dec. 25 in the United States and Canada.

The movie is a comedy about a CIA attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as ""undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war"" in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The bank is a subsidiary of London-based HSBC Group, which has operations worldwide in 74 countries and territories.

Information compromised in the breach includes debit and credit cardholder names, account numbers and expiration dates. The bank says that, so far, it has not seen any evidence of fraud or other suspicious activity arising from the incident.

HSBC Turkey detected the attack in the past week through its internal security controls, according to an FAQ. The attack was limited to Turkey, and all card operations have been restored to normal functioning, the bank says. No other details about the nature of the incident were revealed.

An investigation is under way in collaboration with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey and other relevant authorities, HSBC Turkey says. Turkey's Public Prosecutor's Office has also been notified about the incident.

Timely Notification
Remediation and customer care stand out as the true litmus tests for how companies are perceived after a data breach, says John Buzzard, manager for products and fraud operations at FICO Card Alert Service. ""Consumers want to see a unified, transparent message stream, and I think HSBC delivered,"" he says.

But a true review of the bank's notification practices will come when better insight into the nature of the breach is revealed, says Tom Wills, director of Ontrack Advisory, a consulting firm focused on payments innovation. ""If it was an advanced persistent threat and they managed to detect it early, that would speak well of their detection and response capability,"" he says. ""But it's too early to really say.""

Breach Response
""The HSBC Group takes the security of its customers' information extremely seriously and constantly reviews systems and security,"" the institution says. ""We are leveraging the strength of HSBC's global network and security expertise to take swift and decisive action.""

As a result of the breach, the bank says it has implemented enhanced security measures to improve the security of its information systems and card transactions.

The HSBC Turkey breach comes just a few weeks after JPMorgan Chase confirmed that personal information about 76 million households and 7 million small businesses had been breached in a sophisticated cyber-attack (see: Chase Breach Offers Detection Lessons). Information compromised in that attack included customers' contact information, including names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses.

Banks still have some of the most secure systems, Wills says. ""But threats have evolved, in both complexity and volume, to the point that it's not feasible to expect 100 percent prevention of breaches. For that reason, the information security industry is moving to more of a detection and response paradigm. Prevention is still critical ... [it's] just no longer enough.""", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1089113/000119312515065289/0001193125-15-065289-index.htm,MDA | Risk Factors,2015-02-26 00:00:00,"HSBC remains susceptible to a wide range of cyber risks that impact and/or are facilitated by technology.

An investigation by the BBC programme Money Box found that fraudsters accessed Booking.com reservations, enabling them to obtain contact details which they used to send customers demands for pre-payment. The security breach is believed to have affected customers in the UK, US, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The company insisted it is not the victim of a data breach, but that criminals are obtaining customer details by sending messages to hotels to acquire guest details.

This is known as a phishing scam: when criminals acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by sending emails masquerading as sent by trustworthy companies.

In this case scammers gained customers' emails – either from hacking into Booking.com or hotel security systems – and emailed customers to ask for upfront payments for hotel bookings they had made through the site.

Several customers told the BBC they had been targeted by the scammers, and in some cases had been duped into paying thousands of pounds.

Claire Coldwell from West Yorkshire told the BBC that she used had Booking.com to book hotel rooms for her and her colleagues who were attending a trade fair in London, and got an email purportedly from the Hilton Hotel she had a reservation with, asking for £3,000 in advance.

She told BBC News: ""I got an email supposedly from Booking.com saying that because of the unusually high demand for those dates, the Hilton had taken the decision to ask for pre-payment in full for the whole week.""

Coldwell then got an email supposedly from the Hilton with similar demands. ""They had everything like the reservation number, names of guests and the logos looked accurate.""


(Booking.com UK)
And Jane from Niagara Falls in Canada used Booking.com to reserve a room for a four-day stay in London. She received an email claiming to be from Booking.com, and told the BBC: ""It looked very authentic. I fell for it. We paid approximately C$1,500 (£700)."" She complained to Booking.com and it refunded her.

Peter Kornelisse, chief security officer at Booking.com, said it was working with hotels to make security improvements and notifying guests that it knew were affected by the phishing scams: ""We estimate around 10,000 people are affected. We are protecting our customers, hotels and Booking.com continuously. We have a battle against organised crime. We've made technical improvements in several areas.""

But Ramesh Siram, general manager of the Shoreditch Inn, London, said Booking.com was too slow to react to the security breach, and customer service agents were not aware of the problem.

However, Kornelisse insisted that Booking.com customers were informed ""to a certain extent"".

He added: ""We can warn today about a specific scenario that takes place and the next moment we have a different scenario. We contacted all the guests who are affected by the phishing attacks and we took the burden of our guests.""

A spokesperson for Hilton Worldwide added: ""Our initial investigation has found this incident is not the result of a breach of Hilton systems or websites.

""We have asked Booking.com to ensure their investigation is thorough, and appropriate action is taken. Guests who have received suspicious emails should contact their booking provider immediately and not respond to these emails.""

Booking.com, which is based in the Netherlands, says on its website that  its customers book 700,000 room nights in more than 200 countries every day.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,1097.75,1135.969970703125,1079.9599609375,1022.4199829101562,1215.989990234375,1185.010009765625,1264.1500244140625,1178.1600341796875,1141.4300537109375,1351.800048828125,1245.25,1275.449951171875,1449.9000244140625,,

In at least some instances, they've also been able to post fraudulent charges on credit cards associated with those Hilton loyalty accounts.

Security blogger Brian Krebs tells the story of Brendan Brothers, a Canadian man who, somewhat ironically, co-owns a software security firm focusing on fraud detection. Brothers checked his Hilton account a few days ago and discovered nearly a quarter-million rewards points had gone missing; the thieves had used them to pay for a half-dozen hotel stays at Hilton properties up and down the East Coast.

After spending all the rewards points in the account, the thieves then used the corporate credit card attached to that account to buy still more reward points for themselves.

Though Brothers is disputing those charges with his credit card company, he says he hasn't heard from Hilton about the fate of his stolen reward points.

Big discount
On Oct. 30, the Loyalty Lobby blog (“Making sense of travel loyalty programs”) reported that hackers were selling compromised HHonors reward points online for a tiny fraction of their non-stolen value: up to 100,000 points for only $4.50.

Krebs surreptitiously checked other online crime forums, and calculated that the points stolen from Brothers, which the thieves ultimately used to get about $1,200 worth of hotel stays for themselves, probably would've sold for only $12.

How did the hackers manage to break into the Hilton accounts in the first place? It's possible that, at least initially, they cracked people's passcodes with a brute-force hacking, using software to systematically choose every possible password character combination until the right one is discovered (by “brute force”).

But on Oct. 8, Loyalty Lobby reported that Hilton had changd its rewards account login page to include a CAPTCHA field, speculating that it might be in response to possible brute-force password breaks. Presumably, that would preclude brute-force hacking as an explanation for any rewards points stolen after the CAPTCHA introduction.  

If you have a Hilton HHonors account, especially one you haven't used recently, you must check your account status at once to make sure you have the correct number of points, and also double-check any credit cards which might be attached to that account, either to pay for Hilton hotel stays or to buy further reward points.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1585689/000158568915000032/0001585689-15-000032-index.htm,Risk Factors,2015-02-18 00:00:00,"Cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business.

From time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. The techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. For example, in 2011 we were notified by Epsilon, our database marketing vendor, that we were among a group of companies served by Epsilon that were affected by a data breach that resulted in an unauthorized third party gaining access to Epsilon’s files that included names and e-mails of certain of our customers. Since this notification we have been subject to additional cyber-attacks and data breaches.

Even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us.

The security experts report that beginning in early September, the payment data systems at Kmart stores were purposely infected with a new form of malware (similar to a computer virus). This resulted in debit and credit card numbers being compromised.
 
Based on the forensic investigation to date, no personal information, no debit card PIN numbers, no email addresses and no social security numbers were obtained by those criminally responsible. There is also no evidence that kmart.com customers were impacted. This data breach has been contained and the malware has been removed. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our members and customers.
 
It’s important to note that the policies of the credit card companies state that customers have zero liability for any unauthorized charges if they report them in a timely manner.
 
The privacy and security of our customers’ information is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to doing everything we can to safeguard our customers’ information in the face of a recent surge of data attacks. To further protect our members and customers who shopped with a credit or debit card in our Kmart stores during the month of September through yesterday (Oct. 9, 2014), Kmart will be offering free credit monitoring protection.
 
Given the criminal nature of this attack, Kmart is working closely with federal law enforcement authorities, our banking partners as well as security experts in this ongoing investigation.
 
I want our customers to be aware of the situation and I suggest that customers carefully review and monitor their credit and debit card account statements. If customers see any sign of suspicious activity, they should immediately contact their card issuer. More guidance is also available on our website, kmart.com and customers can contact our customer care center at 888-488-5978.",http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1310067/000119312514369356/d803829d8k.htm,2014-10-09 00:00:00,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1310067/000131006715000009/0001310067-15-000009-index.htm,Risk Factors,2015-03-17 00:00:00," If we do not maintain the security of our member and customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.
Cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving. Techniques or software used to gain unauthorized access, and/or disable, degrade or harm our systems may be difficult to detect or scope for prolonged periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or put in place protective or preventive measures. These attempts to gain unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. If individuals are successful in infiltrating, breaking into, disrupting, damaging or otherwise stealing from the computer systems of the Company or its third-party providers we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, we may face costly litigation, government investigations, government enforcement actions, fines and/or lawsuits, the ability for our members to earn or redeem points in our Shop Your Way® program may be impacted or halted, and our reputation with our members and customers may be significantly harmed. As publicly announced on October 10, 2014, Kmart’s information technology team detected on October 9, 2014 that the Kmart store payment data system had been criminally breached beginning in early September, that the payment data systems at Kmart stores were purposely infected with a new form of malware, and that debit and credit card numbers were potentially compromised. In December 2014, First NBC Bank filed a putative class action lawsuit against us in the Northern District of Illinois for alleged violations relating to, and harm resulting from, the incident. Two other similar lawsuits were filed by financial institutions against us in February 2015 in the Western District of Pennsylvania and the Eastern District of Louisiana.

EDINA, MINN. — International Dairy Queen, Inc. today confirmed that the systems of some DQ® locations and one Orange Julius® location in the U.S. had been infected with the widely-reported Backoff malware that is targeting retailers across the country.  The company previously indicated that it was investigating a possible malware intrusion that may have affected some payment cards used at certain DQ locations in the U.S.  Upon learning of the issue, the company conducted an extensive investigation and retained external forensic experts to help determine the facts.  Because nearly all DQ and Orange Julius locations are independently owned and operated, the company worked closely with affected franchise owners, as well as law enforcement authorities and the payment card brands, to assess the nature and scope of the issue.  The investigation revealed that a third-party vendor’s compromised account credentials were used to access systems at some locations.

The investigation has established the following:

The Backoff malware only impacted payment card data at 395 of the more than 4,500 U.S. locations.
The time periods during which the Backoff malware was present on the relevant systems vary by location.  A list of impacted locations, as well as the relevant time periods, is available at www.dq.com/datasecurityincident/. 
The affected systems contained payment card customer names, numbers and expiration dates.  The company has no evidence that other customer personal information, such as Social Security numbers, PINs or email addresses, was compromised as a result of this malware infection.
Based on our investigation, we are confident that this malware has been contained.
“We are committed to working with and supporting our affected DQ and Orange Julius franchise owners to address this incident,” said John Gainor, president and CEO of International Dairy Queen.  “Our customers continue to be our top priority.”  The company is offering free identity repair services for one year to customers in the U.S. who used their payment card at one of the impacted DQ locations or the one Orange Julius location during the relevant time period.  The company has posted information about these services and other steps that affected DQ and Orange Julius customers can take to help protect themselves on the company’s website at www.dq.com/datasecurityincident/.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,220445.0,220445.0

A little over a month after announcing that its computer systems had been hacked in a potential data breach, the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based company said Monday that it recently discovered malware installed by “an intruder” on point-of-sale systems at some of its Shop ‘n Save, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, and Cub Foods franchises, along with a few associated liquor stores. The malware breach also affects certain locations of the Albertsons’s grocery chain, which uses Supervalu’s information technology services in its Albertson’s, Acme, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s, and Star Market stores.

Supervalu  SVU -1.83%  says this latest instance was “a separate intrusion” from the one announced in mid-August, in which the company found that its computer network had been hacked in a breach that might have led to the theft of customers’ payment card data from more than 200 grocery stores between mid-June and mid-July.

The company said the more recent breach involves malware it believes was installed either in late August or early September. Supervalu is working with federal law authorities in an attempt to identify those responsible for installing the malware and the company has also notified major payment card brands of the incident.

The company did point out that its security systems helped mitigate the damage that could have resulted from the malware. “We’ve taken measures to install enhanced protective technology that we believe significantly limited the ability of this malware to capture payment card data and we will continue to make these investments going forward,” Supervalu CEO Sam Duncan said in a statement.

In this instance, the grocery chain thinks that most of its customers’ credit or debit cards were safe from this particular attack. In this latest breach, Supervalu believes that while the malware was widespread, it only may have captured data came from only four of its Cub Foods grocery stores located in Minnesota. And, even in those instances, the company says it has not yet figured out whether or not any cardholder data was actually stolen.

Supervalu’s stock was down about 1.5% in after-hours trading on Monday evening after having fallen more than 1.8% during the day. The company’s second data breach announcement in as many months comes as the latest blow to consumer confidence in a retail industry that has been hit with several similar intrusions. EBay  EBAY -0.51%  and Target  TGT -0.17%  have both suffered through high-profile breaches in the past year, while both Home Depot  HD 0.04%  and the sandwich chain Jimmy John’s have had similar issues in the past month.",http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920522/000114036114036608/form8k.htm,2014-09-29 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,179.82000732421875,195.83999633789062,202.41000366210938,211.5,227.30999755859366,222.42999267578125,232.3699951171875,229.5,224.97999572753903,210.4900054931641,222.32000732421875,220.66000366210938,214.8500061035156,198.5,197.5

services in Oregon, Nevada, and/or California.
In April 2014, certain of our employees were the subject of a targeted phishing attack. As a result of this phishing 
attack, the attackers obtained username and password information for a small number of our employee email 
accounts and logged into a subset of those accounts intermittently from April 14 through April 16, 2014. These 
email accounts are hosted by a recognized third-party service provider. Our investigation revealed no evidence that 
the attackers penetrated FNF’s internal network or systems. Upon learning of this attack, FNF promptly notified 
federal law enforcement and began an investigation. FNF worked with a third-party security expert to determine the 
scope of the attack.
We are writing to inform you that, through our ongoing investigation, we have learned that some of your personal 
information, including SSN, bank account number, credit/debit card number and driver's license number, may have 
been accessible during the attack. The investigation has revealed no evidence that the attackers accessed your 
personal information, but the investigation also cannot exclude this possibility based on the evidence available. Our

September 19, 2014


Viator is making customers aware that we have experienced a data compromise that could potentially affect payment card data used to make bookings through Viator's websites and mobile offerings. For those customers who created a Viator account, this compromise may also affect the email address, password and Viator ""nickname"" associated with the account. Protecting the security of our customer information is paramount, and we are taking immediate steps to investigate and determine the full scope of the compromise. We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause.

On September 2, we were informed by our payment card service provider that unauthorized charges occurred on a number of our customers' credit cards. We have hired forensic experts, notified law enforcement and we have been working diligently and comprehensively to investigate the incident, identify how our systems may have been impacted, and secure our systems.

While our investigation is ongoing, we are in the process of notifying approximately 1.4 million Viator customers, who had some form of information potentially affected by the compromise:

We are notifying approximately 880,000 customers whom we currently believe may have had their payment card information (encrypted credit or debit card number, card expiration date, name, billing address and email address), and possibly their Viator account information (email address, encrypted password and Viator ""nickname"") compromised. We have no reason to believe at this time that the three or four digit code printed at the back or front of customers' cards were compromised. Additionally, debit PIN numbers are not collected by Viator and could therefore not be compromised.

In addition, we are notifying approximately 560,000 customers whose Viator account information may have been affected (email address, encrypted password and Viator ""nickname"").
We recommend that all affected customers monitor their card activity and report any fraudulent charges to their credit card company. Customers will not be responsible for fraudulent charges to their accounts if they are reported in a timely manner.

For extra assurance, we are offering free identity protection services, including credit monitoring, for our customers in the U.S. We continue to explore whether there are appropriate comparable options for our customers outside the U.S. who may have been affected by this compromise.

We also are encouraging members to reset their passwords on the Viator site, and on any other sites where they used the same password.

Responding properly to this incident is our top priority, and we are committed to taking all appropriate steps to safeguard our customers' personal information. For over 10 years, Viator's mission has been dedicated to offering travelers the best tours and activities worldwide, and to delivering a superior experience in all our customer interactions.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1526520/000156459014004942/0001564590-14-004942-index.htm,Risk Factors,2014-11-04 00:00:00,"Risks Associated with Transaction-Based Revenue.  We derive only a small percentage of our revenue from transaction-based offerings; however, these types of offerings create additional risk and expense.  Transaction revenue is derived from making online bookings available for, among other things, hotel rooms, vacation rentals and destination activities.  During the course of making these arrangements, we collect, use, transmit and store personal information and other consumer data, and the protection of this data is critically important to us.  An increasing number of websites, including the website operated by our subsidiary Viator, have reported compromises of their systems and the data stored within those systems. We rely on strong encryption, authentication and network perimeter security to effectively secure confidential information; however, despite our security measures, our brands’ information technologies and infrastructures may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or security incidents due to system configurations, employee error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities.   Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of the technology used by us to protect transaction data.  In the future, we expect to expend additional resources to enhance our security measures, protect against security breaches and/or to address problems caused by breaches.

However, we are a community bank, and we are contacting every customer and business that may have been impacted out of an abundance of caution.

Item 7.01.
Regulation FD Disclosure.

In connection with the update on its data breach discussed in Item 8.01 below, on September 18, 2014, The Home Depot, Inc. said that its fiscal third quarter sales, including sales in September, are on plan and provided updated guidance. Based on its fiscal third quarter results to date, the Company confirmed its previous fiscal 2014 sales growth guidance of approximately 4.8 percent. The Company also revised its fiscal 2014 diluted earnings-per-share growth guidance and expects that fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share will grow by 21 percent to approximately $4.54, versus the Company's prior guidance of $4.52.

The Company's fiscal 2014 diluted earnings-per-share guidance includes estimates for the cost to investigate the data breach, provide credit monitoring services to its customers, increase call center staffing, and pay legal and professional services, all of which are expensed as incurred in a gross amount of approximately $62 million, partially offset by a $27 million receivable for costs the Company believes are reimbursable and probable of recovery under its insurance coverage. Further, the Company's fiscal 2014 diluted earnings-per-share guidance includes a pre-tax gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of 3.6 million shares of the common stock of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (""HD Supply""), which occurred and will be recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. The Company's ownership of HD Supply is now approximately 8.2 million shares.

The Company's fiscal 2014 diluted earnings-per-share guidance does not include an accrual for other yet-to-be determined estimated probable losses related to the breach. At this time, other than the breach-related costs contained in the Company's updated fiscal 2014 diluted earnings-per-share guidance, the Company is not able to estimate the costs, or a range of costs, related to the breach. Costs related to the breach may include liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs; liabilities related to the Company's private label credit card fraud and card reissuance; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot's financial results in the fourth quarter and/or future periods.

The information contained in this Item 7.01 is being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of Section 18. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Item 8.01.
Other Events.

On September 18, 2014, The Home Depot®, the world's largest home improvement retailer, confirmed that the malware used in its recent breach has been eliminated from its U.S. and Canadian networks. The Company also has completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment data at point of sale in the Company's U.S. stores, offering significant new protection for customers. Roll-out of enhanced encryption to Canadian stores will be complete by early 2015. Canadian stores are already enabled with EMV ""Chip and PIN"" technology.

Investigation Details
The investigation into a possible breach began on Tuesday morning, September 2, immediately after The Home Depot received reports from its banking partners and law enforcement that criminals may have breached its systems.  

Since then, the Company's IT security team has been working around the clock with leading IT security firms, its banking partners and the Secret Service to rapidly gather facts, resolve the problem and provide information to customers.

The Company's ongoing investigation has determined the following:
•
Criminals used unique, custom-built malware to evade detection. The malware had not been seen previously in other attacks, according to Home Depot's security partners.
•
The cyber-attack is estimated to have put payment card information at risk for approximately 56 million unique payment cards.
•
The malware is believed to have been present between April and September 2014.

To protect customer data until the malware was eliminated, any terminals identified with malware were taken out of service, and the Company quickly put in place other security enhancements. The hackers' method of entry has been closed off, the malware has been eliminated from the Company's systems, and the Company has rolled out enhanced encryption of payment data to all U.S. stores.

There is no evidence that debit PIN numbers were compromised or that the breach has impacted stores in Mexico or customers who shopped online at HomeDepot.com or HomeDepot.ca.

The Home Depot is offering free identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to any customer who used a payment card at a Home Depot store in 2014, from April on.",298000000,100000000.0,100000000,1:14-MD-02583-TWT | 15-cv-02999,	King & Spalding LLP | Alston & Bird LLP | Burns & Levinson LLP | Stites & Harbison PLLC,Scott & Scott LLP | Kirby McInerney LLP | Doffermyre Shields Canfield & Knowles LLC | Williams Law Firm | W Pitts Carr & Associates PC | Michael E Jacobs Law & Consulting LLC | Conley Griggs Partin LLP,25000000.0,91.1500015258789,92.23999786376952,96.08999633789062,98.16000366210938,103.43000030517578,104.43000030517578,116.12000274658205,114.54000091552734,109.5500030517578,111.58999633789062,111.48999786376952,116.88999938964844,116.4800033569336,101.0,101.0

UPS +0.54%  said Wednesday that a data breach at 51 of its UPS Stores may have compromised data on approximately 105,000 customer transactions between January and August.

Customers won't receive individual notification letters because the company doesn't have all cardholder data, a UPS spokesman said. Customers will need to check the UPS Store Inc.'s website to see if they have shopped at a store that might have been affected. The company said it doesn't know how many customers might have been affected—only the number of transactions.

The data breach was limited to the affected stores—about 1% of its more than 4,400 UPS Stores—which run on independent private networks, UPS said. The data breach affected stores in 24 states, including California, Florida, Texas and New York. Other parts of the UPS network weren't affected.

UPS described the breach as being related to malicious software that may have resulted in stolen customer information, including names, postal addresses, email addresses and credit- or debit-card data.

The stores, which are individually owned as franchises, eliminated the malware on Aug. 11, and UPS says it has no evidence of fraud as a result of the breach.

""As soon as we became aware of the potential malware intrusion, we deployed extensive resources to quickly address and eliminate this issue. Our customers can be assured that we have identified and fully contained the incident,"" said Tim Davis, president of the UPS Store subsidiary.

UPS has set up an information website and will offer identity- protection and credit-monitoring services to any customers who may be affected.

The data breach is the latest in a string of intrusions at retailers such as Target Corp. TGT +1.82%  , Neiman Marcus Group and grocery chain Supervalu Inc., SVU -0.41% and restaurant chain P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. Typically, a malicious software attacks the point-of-sale, capturing data when a card is swiped for payment. The attack on Target compromised tens of millions of credit and debit accounts over the holidays last year.

The rise in data breaches has intensified pressure on banks and retailers to introduce a new generation of credit cards embedded with microchips, which are designed to be more secure. Already widely in use in Europe and other parts of the world, chip cards scramble the data as a transaction occurs.

UPS said it recently received a notification from the government alerting it to the malware, which it said wasn't detectable by then-current antivirus software. UPS then hired a security firm to review its systems, prompting the discovery.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072714000036/0001090727-14-000036-index.htm,Risk Factors,2014-11-06 00:00:00,"A significant privacy breach or IT system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our franchised center locations also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities.  Our and our franchisees’ information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business. In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers and franchisees, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant.

A Note from Andi Bosshart, SVP, Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer

What to do if you received a notification letter about this data breach:
We’ve made arrangements with a third-party vendor to provide those affected with identity theft consultation and restoration services. Those who receive a letter should call 1-877-223-3764 between 8 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. (Central) Monday through Friday if they have a question or need assistance. Only those who receive a letter will be eligible for this service and will need the membership number listed on that letter when making the call. This service will not ask for payment or credit card information as a condition of receiving identity theft consultation or restoration services.

PLEASE NOTE: We will NOT call or email anyone requesting any personal information as a result of this situation. If you receive an unsolicited call or email that appears to be from CHSPSC, Community Health Systems, your local hospital or physician office, please do not provide any personal information in response to these calls or emails.

On behalf of Community Health Systems Professional Services Corporation (“CHSPSC”), I want to express sincere regret to the patients of affiliated physician practices and clinics whose data was accessed in a foreign-based cyber-attack of our computer network. We value the trust you have placed in us for your care and it is our priority to ensure those who were affected by this attack are notified about the breach and have their questions answered. If you were affected by the data breach, you will receive a letter with more information and a toll-free number to call to learn about the free credit monitoring and identity theft consultation and restoration services offered to affected patients. The following notice contains more details about the breach, measures we are taking to notify you, and how we are improving the way we protect health your information.

In July 2014, Community Health Systems Professional Services Corporation (“CHSPSC”) confirmed its computer network was the target of an external criminal cyber-attack in April and June 2014.  CHSPSC, a Tennessee company, provides management, consulting, and information technology services to certain clinics and hospital-based physicians in this area.

CHSPSC believes the attacker was an “Advanced Persistent Threat” group originating from China, which used highly sophisticated malware technology to attack CHSPSC’s systems.  The intruder was able to bypass the company’s security measures and successfully copy and transfer some data existing on CHSPSC’s systems.

Since first discovering the attack, CHSPSC has worked closely with federal law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation of the matter.  CHSPSC also engaged an outside forensic expert to conduct a thorough investigation and remediation of this incident.   CHSPSC has implemented efforts designed to protect against future intrusions.  These efforts include implementing additional audit and surveillance technology to detect unauthorized intrusions, adopting advanced encryption technologies, and requiring users to change their access passwords.

The majority of patients of clinics and hospital-based physicians affiliated with CHSPSC were not affected by this breach.  Individuals whose information was taken in this cyber-attack will be mailed a letter informing them about the data breach and how to enroll in free identity theft protection and credit monitoring services. The data taken includes patients’ names, addresses, birthdates, social security numbers, and, in some cases, telephone numbers, and the names of employers or guarantors.  However, to the best of CHSPSC’s knowledge, NO credit card information was taken and NO medical or clinical information was taken.  CHSPSC recommends that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your credit report and accounts for unauthorized activity.

Anyone with questions about this cyber attack can call 1-877-223-3764 toll-free.

We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. During the second quarter of 2014, our computer network was the target of an external, criminal cyber attack resulting in the attacker successfully copying and transferring certain data outside the Company. This data included certain non-medical patient identification data (such as patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers) considered protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) but did not include patient credit card, medical or clinical information. We have incurred certain expenses to remediate and investigate this matter and expect to continue to incur expenses of this nature in the foreseeable future. We also have been subject to multiple purported class action lawsuits in connection with this matter.

Six people were indicted in connection with the alleged scheme to defraud users on the popular online ticket marketplace. According to the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, the proceeds were transferred through a global network of accomplices in the United States, Britain, Russia and Canada.  StubHub, an EBay subsidiary, allows customers to buy and sell tickets to concerts, sporting events and other live entertainment. The company, according to authorities, discovered that more than a thousand accounts had been compromised by hackers who were fraudulently hijacking users’ credit cars.

StubHub implemented new security measures to stop the fraud, but authorities said the hackers were able to get around the new hurdles by using credit card information stolen from additional victims.


An investigation that included law enforcement agencies from across the world  traced the exchanges to Internet protocol addresses, PayPal accounts, bank accounts and other financial accounts used by the six people indicted.  A StubHub spokesman told the Los Angeles Times that the alleged hackers either got user names and passwords “from the breach of other websites (i.e. Target)” or through the use of keystroke loggers or malware installed on the users’ computers. “Our customers are our No. 1 priority. Once fraudulent transactions were detected on a given account, affected customers were immediately contacted by StubHub's Trust and Safety team and refunded any unauthorized transactions,” the company said in a statement.

Vadim Polyakov, 30, and Nikolay Matveychuk, 21, allegedly illegally purchased more than 3,500 e-tickets that were sent to a group of individuals in New York and New Jersey to be resold within hours of events featuring Elton John, Justin Timberlake and Jay Z.


Daniel Petryszyn, 28, Laurence Brinkmeyer, 29, and Bryan Caputo, 29, allegedly resold the tickets they received from Polyakov. The proceeds, according to the district attorney’s office, were divided among multiple PayPal and bank accounts.

Sergei Kirin, 37, a Russian national who allegedly advertised his money-laundering services online, owned one of these accounts and kept a percentage as a fee, prosecutors said.

Polyakov was arrested outside his hotel near Barcelona. Authorities did not immediately answer questions about the whereabouts of the other defendants.

On Wednesday, investigators executed search warrants in New York and New Jersey at the homes of Petryszyn, Brinkmeyer and Caputo.

The systems have been taken offline in an effort to isolate any attacks, according to people familiar with the matter. Journal officials hadn't found any damage or tampering to news graphics, said one of these people, but the systems are still being reviewed for signs of compromise.

A spokeswoman for the Journal said, ""We are investigating an incident related to wsj.com's graphics systems. At this point we see no evidence of any impact to Dow Jones customers or customer data.""  The publisher's response follows a hacker's claims on Twitter to have penetrated the wsj.com website. The hacker is offering to sell not only user information but also the credentials necessary to control the server. That ability would allow a buyer to ""modify articles, add new content, insert malicious content in any page, add new users, delete users and so on,"" said Andrew Komarov, chief executive of IntelCrawler, a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity firm, who brought the hack to the attention of the Journal.

Mr. Komarov said his team discovered the vulnerability used by the hacker and confirmed that it could give an attacker the access claimed.

Mr. Komarov said his firm has been monitoring this attacker, whose nickname was Rev0lver, but who now calls himself Worm, and who has founded Worm.in, a market for trading cyber vulnerabilities.

Using a screenshot that Worm had included in his tweet, Mr. Komarov said that IntelCrawler confirmed the vulnerability. ""We confirmed there is the opportunity to get access to any database on the wsj.com server, a list of over 20 databases hosted on this server,"" he said. The vulnerability was in a graphics database involving maps, he said.

Those affected were notified Friday.  The hacker gained access through a subcontractor’s system to get individuals’ names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, gender and dates of birth, StayWell Health Management LLC said in a statement Tuesday.
Salt Lake City-based StayWell also said the hacker accessed password information for the system of subcontractor Onsite Health Diagnostics, though the passwords themselves were encrypted.
The breach involves information belonging to Dominion Resources’ employees, spouses and domestic partners who went online to schedule a health-screening appointment going back to 2012, the energy company said, including about 1,100 people in Virginia.
“Dominion regrets the data breach at a third-party vendor,” Dominion Resources spokesman C. Ryan Frazier said Tuesday. “We are taking this matter seriously and are conducting a thorough review of all of these types of vendors.”
To their knowledge, the hacked information hasn’t been further misused, Dominion Resources and StayWell said.
Richmond-based Dominion Resources has advised those affected by the breach to change their usernames and passwords, he said. The company also is offering them a free one-year membership in a program that protects employees through credit monitoring.
StayWell is Dominion Resources’ vendor for its “Well on Your Way” program, which includes a health screening. Onsite Health Diagnostics, based in Irvine, Texas, provided the sign-up mechanism for the program’s health-screening appointments.
Onsite Health Diagnostics did not respond Tuesday for a request for comment.
According to StayWell, Onsite Health Diagnostics said the breach occurred March 25 but wasn’t discovered immediately.
After discovering the hacking, Onsite Health Diagnostics notified StayWell on June 16, StayWell said.
Dominion Resources said the company was notified of the breach on June 24 but didn’t learn the identities of those affected until July 7.
Frazier said Dominion Resources is investigating why it took so long for the company to be alerted, adding that they are no longer using Onsite Health Diagnostics for scheduling.", , ,ND,,,,,,,,,,,68.90000152587889,68.29000091552734,68.66000366210939,68.18000030517578,71.56999969482422,71.9800033569336,76.44999694824219,72.91000366210938,68.95999908447266,71.62999725341797,71.5999984741211,67.09999847412111,69.19999694824219,71.0,70.5

A representative from the group calling itself W0rm told CNET News in a Twitter conversation that it stole a database of usernames, emails, and encrypted passwords from CNET's servers.

W0rm is claiming that the database of stolen information includes data on more than 1 million users.

A CBS Interactive spokeswoman said that ""a few servers were accessed"" by the intruder. ""We identified the issue and resolved it a few days ago. We will continue to monitor,"" for potential impact, she said.

W0rm said it found its way into CNET's servers through a security hole in CNET.com's implementation of the Symfony PHP framework, a popular programming tool that provides a skeleton on which developers can construct a complex website.

Properties owned by CBS Interactive, which includes CNET, were the ninth-most visited sites in the US during May. According to ComScore, CNET had 27.1 million U.S. unique visitors on desktop and mobile in June 2014.

The W0rm representative, a non-native English speaker, said the group had no plans to decrypt the passwords or to complete the sale of the database. W0rm tweeted Monday that it will sell the database for 1 bitcoin -- around $622. But the group's spokesperson said they offered to sell the database to gain attention -- ""nothing more.""  W0rm claims that its goals are altruistic, and that it hacked CNET servers to improve the overall security of the Web. By targeting high-profile sites, the group says it can raise awareness about security flaws. W0rm claims to have successfully hacked the BBC in late 2013, as well as earlier hacks of Adobe Systems and Bank of America websites.

CNET's popularity is what motivated the group to target the site. ""[W]e are driven to make the Internet a better and safer [place] rather than a desire to protect copyright,"" W0rm said in a Twitter exchange on Monday. ""I want to note that the experts responsible for bezopastnost [security] in cnet very good work but not without flaws.""

Robert Hansen, a Web security expert at White Hat Security, said CNET readers might not be at risk.

""It definitely can feel like a slap in the face to an organization to be hacked, but in reality, most of the time in circumstances like this it's actually a good thing,"" Hansen said. ""W0rm was careful not to give the full path to the actual exploit, and informed the general public that the compromise occurred.""", , ,ND,, , ,,,,,,,,60.68000030517578,59.34000015258789,57.2599983215332,48.90999984741211,51.86999893188477,53.47999954223633,55.599998474121094,59.83000183105469,60.93000030517578,61.31999969482422,59.72000122070313,58.4900016784668,55.540000915527344,,

The criminal complaint, dated June 27 and made public last week, describes in some detail how the alleged conspirators patiently observed Boeing and its computer network for a year, and then breached the contractor's systems to steal intellectual property on the C-17 military transport. It also casts light on the free-enterprise nature of cyber-snooping, as the co-conspirators allegedly exchanged e-mails about profiting from their enterprise.  U.S. authorities accuse Su Bin, a Chinese businessman residing in Canada, of helping direct two other Chinese nationals in cyberattacks to obtain information about the C-17 and other military projects. The complaint says that Su, who was arrested last month in Canada, and two-unnamed co-conspirators, identified as UC1 and UC2, targeted information related to parts and performance of the C-17 transport and Lockheed Martin's F-22 and F-35 fighter jets. Su, who was arrested last month, is in jail in Canada, awaiting a bail hearing.

The initial attacks against Boeing occurred between Jan 14 and March 20, 2010, and for part of that time Su was in the United States, FBI Special Agent Noel Neeman says in the complaint. The documents do not describe how the information about the Lockheed Martin jet fighters were obtained.

Did Chinese Embellish Hack?
Neeman says an e-mail attachment sent by UC1 and eventually uncovered by American authorities claims the Chinese successfully exfiltrated 65 gigabytes of data over two years, including information on the C-17 transport from Boeing computers. Although evidence exists that information was stolen from Boeing computers, Neeman says he hasn't found any proof that the stolen information was classified. ""The success and scope of the operation could have been exaggerated,"" Neeman says.

Still, the documents the FBI says it obtained provide a colorful and rather positive narrative from the Chinese perspective about the planning and attacks on the computer systems that began in 2009 with a reconnaissance of Boeing and the initial breach in early 2010.

The e-mail attachment describes the difficulty of breaching and the complexity of the Boeing system, with 18 domains and 10,000 machines and ""huge quantities"" of anti-invasion security equipment. ""Through painstaking labor and slow groping, we finally discovered C-17 strategic transport aircraft-related materials stored in the secret network,"" the document says.

Later, the attached report states, ""Experts have confirmed that the documents were truly C-17 related and the data scope involved the landing gear, flight control system and airdrop system, etc. Experts inside China have a high opinion of them, express that the C-17 data were the first ever seen in the country and confirming the documents' value and their unique nature in China.""

Avoiding Detection
The alleged hackers, in the report, explain they had to plan meticulously and employ vigorous technical support to pilfer the data. ""From breaking into its internal network to obtaining intelligence, we repeatedly skipped around in its internal network to make it harder to detect reconnaissance, and we also skipped around at suitable times in countries outside the U.S. In the process of skipping, we were supported by a prodigious quantity of tools, routes and servers, which also ensured the smooth landing of intelligence data.""

To evade tracking by American law enforcement, the report says the hackers planned for numerous skip routes in many countries. ""The routes went through at least three countries, and we ensured one of them did not have friendly relations with the U.S.,"" the document says. The hackers used so-called jump servers, special purpose computers on a network typically used to manage devices in separate security zones.

Another document the FBI has obtained describes communications between UC1 and UC2, which says they successfully acquired information about U.S. military technology by establishing hot points in the U.S., France, Japan and Hong Kong. According to the complaint, the report says those involved received 6.8 million Chinese yuan, or about $1 million, to build a team and infrastructure outside of China. The report did not say who funded the operation, but said part of the funding came from a loan of 4.6 million yuan, or $742,000.

Freelance E-Spies
The criminal complaint suggests the co-conspirators weren't employees of Chinese intelligence or the military, but freelancers who faced a bureaucracy to get paid. An e-mail dated April 5, 2010, that Su sent UC1 states, ""It's not that easy to sell the information. If money is collected for the sample of (C-)17, it won't be easy to collect our big money that would follow. Also, it's a long process to apply for the expenses."" Later, UC1 replied, ""It's putting pressure on you, not selling for money. It's just a bargaining chip.""

Neeman says he believes UC1 was explaining that the sample document being shown to potential buyers was not intended to be for sale, but rather to be a bargaining chip to advance the overall negotiations and sale. ""This e-mail exchange shows that both Su and UC1 were seeking the 'big money' that would result from selling the information they had acquired,"" Neeman says in the complaint.

The FBI special agent says the conspirators likely sought to sell the pilfered information to various customers, including aircraft corporations operated by the Chinese military.

A major complaint often voiced by the U.S. government about Chinese hacking is that the Chinese steal intellectual property from Western businesses to save years and millions - if not billions - of dollars in developing competing wares. That point was acknowledged in documents cited in the criminal complaint. Noting that the development costs of the C-17 transport reached $3.4 million, one of the alleged conspirators wrote that they were ""making important contributions to our national defense research development and receiving unanimous favorable comments"" by obtaining the Boeing documents.

According to The New York Times, Boeing will cease production of the C-17 after two decades of building the planes. The paper reports that the Chinese government is developing its own cargo plane similar in some respects to the C-17.

U.S.-Chinese Tension Over Cyberattacks
Relations between the U.S. and China have soured over cyberattacks. Documents provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden show that the agency hacked into servers of Huawei and exploited the Chinese telecommunications conglomerate's technology, so that when it sold equipment to other countries, the NSA could roam through the company's computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance (see Rebuilding America's Online Reputation)

The U.S. has long griped that Chinese hacking is conducted for economic advantage, while its intrusions are done to gather national security information. That was a point driven home in May, when Atty. Gen. Eric Holder announced the indictments of five Chinese military officers at a press conference (see The Real Aim of U.S. Indictment of Chinese).

But the top brass in Washington have remained silent regarding the charges against Su; there was no formal announcement by government officials. The case only came to light when the government unsealed the criminal complaint filed with the U.S. Magistrate in Los Angeles. And, while the U.S. authorities intend to seek extradition of Su from Canada to stand trial, the charges against the five military officers is seen more as a political statement to highlight Chinese attacks against American companies to steal trade secrets.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,126.79000091552734,120.8000030517578,128.22000122070312,121.5,124.63999938964844,124.63999938964844,131.53999328613278,148.0399932861328,152.4199981689453,154.3800048828125,145.88999938964844,141.6199951171875,144.47999572753906,83.5,94.21428571428572

Customer names, delivery addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passwords were taken from a server used in an online ordering system that the company is in the process of replacing, Dominos spokesman Chris Brandon said on Monday.

He said he did not know if the stolen passwords had been encrypted.

A Tweet directed at Domino's customers through an account of somebody listed as ""Rex Mundi"" said hackers would publish the customer data on the Internet unless the company pays 30,000 euros ($40,800), according to an article in The Telegraph.

The Rex Mundi account was later suspended.

Brandon said he was not familiar with the ransom demands, but that the company would not be making any such payment.

Domino's Vice President of Communications Tim McIntyre said the hacking was ""isolated"" to independent franchise markets of Belgium and France, where the company's online ordering system did not collect credit card orders, so no financial data had been taken.

""This does not affect any market outside of France and Belgium,"" he said via email. ""The site has been secured.""

April 17, 2014

Dear Valued Customers:

In January, we notified you that we might have experienced a data security incident. We wanted you to know quickly so you could take steps to monitor activity on your payment card account.

Since that time, we have continued our extensive investigation with the help of two independent, expert security firms. We have also been working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating with banks and payment processors to determine the facts.

After weeks of analysis, we have discovered evidence confirming that systems of Michaels stores in the United States and our subsidiary, Aaron Brothers, were attacked by criminals using highly sophisticated malware that had not been encountered previously by either of the security firms.

We want you to know we have identified and fully contained the incident, and we can assure you the malware no longer presents a threat to customers while shopping at Michaels or Aaron Brothers.

Here are additional facts we have determined from our continuing investigation:

The affected systems contained certain payment card information, such as payment card number and expiration date, about both Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers. There is no evidence that other customer personal information, such as name, address or PIN, was at risk in connection with this issue.
Regarding Michaels stores, the attack targeted a limited portion of the point-of-sale systems at a varying number of stores between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014. Only a small percentage of payment cards used in the affected stores during the times of exposure were impacted by this issue. The analysis conducted by the security firms and the Company shows that approximately 2.6 million cards may have been impacted, which represents about 7% of payment cards used at Michaels stores in the U.S. during the relevant time period. The locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Michaels store are listed on www.michaels.com.
Regarding Aaron Brothers, the Company has confirmed that between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014, 54 Aaron Brothers stores were affected by this malware. The Company estimates that approximately 400,000 cards were potentially impacted during this period. The locations for each affected Aaron Brothers store are listed on www.aaronbrothers.com.
The Company has received a limited number of reports from the payment card brands and banks of fraudulent use of payment cards potentially connected to Michaels or Aaron Brothers.
We are truly sorry and deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause. Our customers are always our number one priority and we are committed to retaining your trust and loyalty.

While we have received limited reports of fraud, we are offering identity protection and credit monitoring services to affected Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers in the U.S. for 12 months at no cost to them. We also are offering these customers a fraud assistance service for 12 months at no cost to them. This service provides customers with a trained representative to assist them in the event they experience a fraud-related issue resulting from this incident. Information on the services can be found here.

We encourage you to actively monitor all of your payment card account activity and immediately contact your bank or card issuer if you notice any suspicious activity. You can find more security tips and information on this website.

In an era where very sophisticated and determined criminals have proven capable of successfully attacking a wide range of computer networks, we must all increase our level of vigilance. We are committed to working with other parties to improve the security of payment card transactions for all consumers.

If you have any questions or would like more information, please call us toll-free at 1-877-412-7145. Representatives are available to answer your questions Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. CT to 8:00 p.m. CT.

We appreciate your patience and sincerely apologize again for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,

Chuck Rubin

The protection of our customer, associate and Company data is critically important to us. Our customers and associates have a high expectation that we will adequately safeguard and protect their sensitive personal information. We have become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a portion of our business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations.  This risk will increase with the launch of our ecommerce platform.  Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.  Any failure to maintain the security of our customers’ sensitive information, or data belonging to ourselves or our suppliers, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of our customers’ confidence in us, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation.
 
In January 2014, we learned of possible fraudulent activity on some U.S. payment cards that had been used at Michaels, suggesting we may have experienced a data security attack. The Company retained two independent, expert security firms to conduct an extensive investigation.  The Company also has been working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating with banks and payment processors to determine the facts.
 
After extensive analysis, we discovered evidence confirming that systems of Michaels stores in the United States and its subsidiary, Aaron Brothers, were attacked by criminals using highly sophisticated malware that had not been encountered previously by either of the security firms (the “Data Breach”).
 
The Company believes it has now identified the malware and it no longer presents a threat while shopping at Michaels or Aaron Brothers.  During the course of the investigation, we determined the following:
 
·      The affected systems contained certain payment card information, such as payment card number and expiration date, about both Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers.  There is no evidence that other customer personal information, such as name, address or PIN, was at risk in connection with this issue.
·      Regarding Michaels stores, the attack potentially targeted a limited portion of the point-of-sale systems at a varying number of stores between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014.  Only a small percentage of payment cards used in the affected stores during the times of exposure were impacted by this issue.  The analysis conducted by the security firms and the Company shows that approximately 2.6 million cards may have been impacted, which represents about 7% of payment cards used at Michaels stores in the U.S. during the relevant time period.
 
·      Regarding Aaron Brothers, we have confirmed that between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014, 54 Aaron Brothers stores were affected by this malware.  We estimate that approximately 400,000 cards were potentially impacted during this period.
 
·      We have received a limited number of reports from the payment card brands and banks of fraudulent use of payment cards potentially connected to Michaels or Aaron Brothers.
 
We are offering identity protection, credit monitoring and fraud assistance services to affected Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers in the U.S. for 12 months at no cost to them.  In addition, the Data Breach has given rise to putative class action litigation on behalf of customers and regulatory investigations, as further described under “Legal Proceedings”.
 
There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a similar criminal attack in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely way. Regardless of the conclusion of the investigation, the publicity resulting from the Data Breach could adversely affect the Michaels and Aaron Brothers brands, has caused us to incur legal and other fees and could cause us to incur additional material fees, and could discourage customers from shopping in our stores.",10000000,,,,,,,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,16.309999465942386,14.890000343322756,17.90999984741211,17.440000534057614,21.649999618530273,23.229999542236328,22.88999938964844,27.46999931335449,29.270000457763672,28.25,,

Microsoft often charges the FBI's most secretive division hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to legally view customer information, according to documents allegedly hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army.

The SEA, a hacker group loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, is best known for hijacking Western media companies' social media accounts. (These companies include the Associated Press, CNN, NPR, and even the Daily Dot.) The SEA agreed to let the Daily Dot analyze the documents with experts before the group published them in full.

The documents consist of what appear to be invoices and emails between Microsoft's Global Criminal Compliance team and the FBI's Digital Intercept Technology Unit (DITU), and purport to show exactly how much money Microsoft charges DITU, in terms of compliance costs, when DITU provides warrants and court orders for customers' data.

In December 2012, for instance, Microsoft emailed DITU a PDF invoice for $145,100, broken down to $100 per request for information, the documents appear to show.

At the time of this discovery, we immediately engaged a top-tier forensics firm (Verizon) to investigate this security incident.    As a result of this ongoing investigation, we have now discovered evidence that fewer than 25,000 records containing card-present (track 2) payment card data have been illegally accessed on our systems and we believe it may have been removed.  As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation.  As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.

We take this criminal activity very seriously. We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident.  In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter. 

Customers are our top priority at Sally Beauty, and we will be responding to customers' needs concerning this security incident.  Please check our website sallybeautyholdings.com in the coming days to learn about the progress of our work to address the security incident, the status of our investigation, and steps we will be taking to assist any affected customer.

As previously disclosed, we discovered the Data Security Incident in late February when we detected illegally installed malicious software (malware) on certain parts of our information technology systems, including our point of sale systems. Our General Counsel immediately engaged forensic experts to assist us in our investigation of the Data Security Incident, which is continuing. As a result of our ongoing investigation, we discovered and are reviewing forensic evidence that a portion of the payment card data (track 2) for some transactions on our systems primarily during the period from February 21, 2014 to February 28, 2014 may have been illegally accessed and removed by the malware. We completed the removal of the malware from our point of sale systems and believe that the Data Security Incident has been contained.
 
The costs that we have incurred to date in connection with the Data Security Incident primarily include professional advisory and legal costs relating to our continuing investigation of the Data Security Incident. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the Data Security Incident in the future. As detailed in Item 1A -“Risk Factors - Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results,” these costs may result from potential liabilities to payment card networks, governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation and legal and other fees necessary to defend against any potential liabilities or claims. We are unable at this time to determine the probability of or to reasonably estimate the magnitude of these potential liabilities. The potential liabilities or other remedies against us related to the Data Security Incident may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Please see “Risk Factors - We experienced a data security incident and are not yet able to determine the full extent or scope of the potential liabilities relating to this data security incident” in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report.

Smucker Company, an Ohio-based producer of fruit spreads and beverages, has shut down its Online Store following a data breach affecting its customers' personal financial information.

According to a letter sent to individuals whose data may have been compromised, the company was “made aware” of the breach on February 12, 2014, and affects anyone who made a purchase on its Online Store between December 2012 and January 2014.

The data obtained by miscreants may have included customer names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, credit and debit card numbers, as well as expiration dates and verification codes.

“We are extremely disappointed this incident occurred and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,” Richard Smucker, CEO of the J.M. Smucker Company, wrote in a statement posted on the Online Store website. “We continue to thoroughly investigate this matter with federal authorities.”

The company is offering two years of free credit protection monitoring for anyone affected by the breach.

In an FAQ addressing the incident, the company alludes to malware that may have swiped the personal information belonging to individuals during their checkout process. This would indicate that the malware utilized in the attack has similar attributes to that of the Zeus trojan, which uses form grabbing – intercepting data submitted into a form field before it's submitted to a website – in order to capture sensitive information.

According to security journalist Brian Krebs, the Smucker's breach is tied to a cyber criminal collective that performed attacks on software giant Adobe, data brokers LexisNexis and Dun & Bradstreet, risk consulting firm Kroll, the National White Collar Crime Center, and credit card processor SecurePay, which all resulted in data breaches.

While some of the previously mentioned breaches were a result of running vulnerable versions of Adobe's web application platform, ColdFusion, Krebs was able to find a reference to Smucker's on a control panel for a ColdFusion botnet that attackers leveraged in 2013 and into this year.

Based on reports of the attack taking place due to a vulnerability on the company's web server, John Pirc, chief technology officer at NSS Labs, believes that they should be held accountable. While end-users should always take precaution and use anti-virus protection, he says it isn't reliable to place responsibilities regarding security on them.

""With the proper procedures, code audits during the system development life cycle, post-production security audits and patches, this 'likely' could have been prevented,"" Pirc said in an email to SCMagazine.com.

Not surprised by the breach, given the recent incidents involving Target and most recently Sally Beauty, Pirc expects this scenario to play out again and again throughout the year.

""The trend in breaches for 2014 will be like the movie ""Groundhog Day"" – we will be reliving the same scenario day after day,"" he said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,99.0500030517578,97.9000015258789,96.94000244140624,102.94000244140624,107.52999877929688,100.9000015258789,102.38999938964844,98.66000366210938,104.06999969482422,101.91999816894531,100.4800033569336,105.87999725341795,114.12000274658205,101.0,101.33333333333331

The attacks struck Medtronic, the world's largest medical device maker, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical sometime during the first half of 2013 and might have lasted as long as several months, according to a source close to the companies.

It's not clear what exactly the hackers were after, but federal laws meant to safeguard medical information require the companies to disclose any breach involving patient information. The companies have made no such disclosures.

All three companies have extensive operations in the Bay Area. Santa Rosa is home to Medtronic's endovascular therapies and coronary businesses. St. Jude Medical operates manufacturing plants in Sunnyvale. Boston Scientific has offices in San Jose, Santa Clara and Fremont. Signs point to China
The attacks were was ""very thorough"" and showed signs they might have been committed by hackers in China, the source said.

The medical device makers were not aware of the intrusions until federal authorities contacted them, and they have formed task forces to investigate the breach, he said.

""Like many companies, Boston Scientific experiences attempts to penetrate our networks and systems and we take such attempts seriously,"" Denise Kaigler, senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said in an e-mail. ""We have a dedicated team to detect and mitigate attacks when they occur as well as to implement solutions to prevent future attacks.""

Kaigler would not comment on the specifics of any attack for security reasons, but described the Chronicle's information as ""inaccurate."" She declined to provide any further detail.

A spokeswoman for Medtronic said the company would also not comment on any specific attack, and St. Jude Medical did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI did not comment.

High-tech companies like medical device makers sit on billions of dollars of intellectual property, making them an attractive target for corporate spies looking for an edge in developing the next blockbuster product.

Cybercrime costs the United States economy about $100 billion each year, according to a study by the Center for Strategic Studies and security software maker McAfee.

""Almost every large company is dealing with constant persistent threats and network reconnaissance from hackers looking for holes and other ways into a company's systems,"" said Joshua Carlson, a data privacy attorney in Minnesota and a former information technology manager at Best Buy Co. ""Those companies that are not ready or prepared, they can see decades and billions of dollars in (intellectual property) disappear in a few seconds.""

Also at stake is the potential loss of confidential patient data. Medtronic, St. Jude Medical and Boston Scientific work closely with doctors, hospitals and medical researchers, who collect clinical trial data that can include personal information.

Data theft has become a growing problem at health care institutions. Recently, St. Joseph Health System in Bryan, Texas, said that over a three-day period in December, hackers gained access to a server containing the Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and medical information of 400,000 current and former patients.

""Information is vulnerable in mass quantities,"" said Lisa Ikemoto, a UC Davis law professor who specializes in health care issues. ""Personal information is protected for a reason.""

Aside from the risk of identity theft, a patient whose information is compromised could face discrimination from employers, schools and insurers, she said.

Federal health privacy laws normally apply to doctors or hospitals, but they can also cover medical device makers who consult with physicians or help fit or test a device, Ikemoto said.

Hacking is a particularly sensitive issue between the United States and China.

Intellectual property
Last summer, amid reports that China regularly tries to steal secrets from American companies and research universities, President Obama pressed Chinese president Xi Jinping on the issue during their summit meeting in California.

""Cyberthreats and cyberattacks are only going to get more sophisticated and more impactful to those companies breached,"" Carlson said.

The group boasted about the hack on Twitter with a link to a Pastebin document containing the data (the data has since been removed). NullCrew also took to Twitter to urge Comcast to “[f]ix the vulnerabilities in your mail servers before we pwn them…” NullCrew also took credit for a data breach at Bell Canada that exposed more than 22,000 usernames, passwords and some credit card data, according to Threatpost. - See more at: http://multichannel.com/news/distribution/comcast-no-evidence-personal-sub-info-obtained-mail-server-hack/260663#sthash.aSsH1erk.dpuf", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,27.01499938964844,26.05500030517578,24.540000915527344,25.90500068664551,26.45499992370605,27.09000015258789,26.45000076293945,27.85000038146973,26.69499969482422,27.690000534057607,28.170000076293945,27.614999771118164,28.459999084472656,33.0,33.166666666666664

Our information technology (IT) and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations.  From time to time we update and/or replace IT systems used by our businesses.  The implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems, resulting in productivity issues, delays in production, shipments or other business operations.  In addition, we outsource certain support functions, including certain global IT infrastructure services, to third-party service providers. Any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  In addition, as a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our IT infrastructure, unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners.  Cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to information, and other security breaches, are persistent, continue to evolve and require highly skilled IT resources.  While we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust.  Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the possibility of any future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated. An IT system failure, issues related to implementation of new IT systems or breach of data security could disrupt our operations, cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information.

January 25, 2014

To Our Valued Michaels Customers:

As you may have read in the news, data security attacks against retailers have become a major topic of concern. We recently learned of possible fraudulent activity on some U.S. payment cards that had been used at Michaels, suggesting we may have experienced a data security attack.

We are working closely with federal law enforcement and are conducting an investigation with the help of third-party data security experts to establish the facts. Although the investigation is ongoing, based on the information we have received and in light of the widely-reported criminal efforts to penetrate the data systems of U.S. retailers, we believe it is appropriate to notify our customers that a potential issue may have occurred.

Throughout our 40-year history, our customers have always been our number one priority and we deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause. The privacy and security of our customers’ information is of critical importance to us and we are focused on addressing this issue.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for unauthorized charges. If you believe your payment card may have been affected, you should immediately contact your bank or card issuer. If we find as part of our investigation that any of our customers were affected, we will offer identity protection and credit monitoring services to them at no cost.

We will provide updates on our website (www.michaels.com) as our investigation continues. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please call us toll-free at 1- 877-412-7145. Representatives will be available to answer questions beginning Sunday January 26, 2014, with operating hours Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. CST to 11:00 p.m. CST and Sunday from 8:00 a.m. CST to 8:00 p.m. CST.

We apologize and truly regret any concern this may cause you.

Sincerely,

Chuck Rubin 
CEO, Michaels Stores", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/740670/000110465914032010/a14-2849_110k.htm,Risk Factors,2014-04-29 00:00:00,"We have recently experienced a data breach and such data breach and any future failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could result in an additional data breach which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
 
The protection of our customer, associate and Company data is critically important to us. Our customers and associates have a high expectation that we will adequately safeguard and protect their sensitive personal information. We have become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a portion of our business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations.  This risk will increase with the launch of our ecommerce platform.  Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.  Any failure to maintain the security of our customers’ sensitive information, or data belonging to ourselves or our suppliers, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of our customers’ confidence in us, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation.
 
In January 2014, we learned of possible fraudulent activity on some U.S. payment cards that had been used at Michaels, suggesting we may have experienced a data security attack. The Company retained two independent, expert security firms to conduct an extensive investigation.  The Company also has been working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating with banks and payment processors to determine the facts.
 
After extensive analysis, we discovered evidence confirming that systems of Michaels stores in the United States and its subsidiary, Aaron Brothers, were attacked by criminals using highly sophisticated malware that had not been encountered previously by either of the security firms (the “Data Breach”).
 
The Company believes it has now identified the malware and it no longer presents a threat while shopping at Michaels or Aaron Brothers.  During the course of the investigation, we determined the following:
 
·      The affected systems contained certain payment card information, such as payment card number and expiration date, about both Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers.  There is no evidence that other customer personal information, such as name, address or PIN, was at risk in connection with this issue.
·      Regarding Michaels stores, the attack potentially targeted a limited portion of the point-of-sale systems at a varying number of stores between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014.  Only a small percentage of payment cards used in the affected stores during the times of exposure were impacted by this issue.  The analysis conducted by the security firms and the Company shows that approximately 2.6 million cards may have been impacted, which represents about 7% of payment cards used at Michaels stores in the U.S. during the relevant time period.
 
·      Regarding Aaron Brothers, we have confirmed that between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014, 54 Aaron Brothers stores were affected by this malware.  We estimate that approximately 400,000 cards were potentially impacted during this period.
 
·      We have received a limited number of reports from the payment card brands and banks of fraudulent use of payment cards potentially connected to Michaels or Aaron Brothers.
 
We are offering identity protection, credit monitoring and fraud assistance services to affected Michaels and Aaron Brothers customers in the U.S. for 12 months at no cost to them.  In addition, the Data Breach has given rise to putative class action litigation on behalf of customers and regulatory investigations, as further described under “Legal Proceedings”.
 
There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a similar criminal attack in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely way. Regardless of the conclusion of the investigation, the publicity resulting from the Data Breach could adversely affect the Michaels and Aaron Brothers brands, has caused us to incur legal and other fees and could cause us to incur additional material fees, and could discourage customers from shopping in our stores.",10000000,,,2:14-cv-07006-JS-ARL | 1:11-cv-03350,	Sidley Austin LLP,	Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP | Lite DePalma Greenberg & Rivas LLC | Siprut PC,0.0,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,17.020000457763672,16.790000915527347,15.619999885559082,17.469999313354492,18.290000915527344,23.32999992370605,24.364999771118164,25.57999992370605,,

Approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts may have been impacted between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013. Target alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was made aware of the unauthorized access, and is putting all appropriate resources behind these efforts.  Among other actions, Target is partnering with a leading third-party forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident.

More information is available at Target’s corporate website. Guests who suspect unauthorized activity should contact Target at: 866-852-8680.

Description of Event

As previously disclosed, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). Based on our investigation to date, we believe that the intruder accessed and stole payment card data from approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts of guests who shopped at our U.S. stores between November 27 and December 15, 2013, through malware installed on our point-of-sale system in our U.S. stores. On December 15, we removed the malware from virtually all registers in our U.S. stores. Payment card data used in transactions made by 56 additional guests in the period between December 16 and December 17 was stolen prior to our disabling malware on one additional register that was disconnected from our system when we completed the initial malware removal on December 15. In addition, the intruder stole certain guest information, including names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses, for up to 70 million individuals. Our investigation of the matter is ongoing, and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties.
Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued  

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $61 million of pretax Data Breach-related expenses, and expected insurance proceeds of $44 million, for net expenses of $17 million ($11 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share. These expenses were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), but were not part of our segment results. Expenses include costs to investigate the Data Breach, provide credit-monitoring services to our guests, increase staffing in our call centers, and procure legal and other professional services.
The $61 million of fourth quarter expenses also includes an accrual related to the expected payment card networks’ claims by reason of the Data Breach. The ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks believe they or their issuing banks have incurred. In order for us to have liability for such claims, we believe that a court would have to find among other things that (1) at the time of the Data Breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards in a manner that contributed to the Data Breach, and (2) the network operating rules around reimbursement of operating costs and counterfeit fraud losses are enforceable. While an independent third-party assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013, we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those standards at the time of the Data Breach. We base that expectation on our understanding that, in cases like ours where prior to a data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent third-party assessor to be fully compliant with those standards, the network-approved forensic investigator nonetheless regularly claims that the breached entity was not in fact compliant with those standards. As a result, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. We expect to dispute the payment card networks’ anticipated claims, and we think it is likely that our disputes would lead to settlement negotiations consistent with the experience of other entities that have suffered similar payment card breaches. We believe such negotiations would effect a combined settlement of both the payment card networks' counterfeit fraud loss allegations and their non-ordinary course operating expense allegations. We based our year-end accrual on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements of the payment card networks’ anticipated claims and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claims were they to be litigated. Currently, we can only reasonably estimate a loss associated with settlements of the networks' expected claims for non-ordinary course operating expenses. The year-end accrual does not include any amounts associated with the networks' expected claims for alleged incremental counterfeit fraud losses because the loss associated with settling such claims, while probable in our judgment, is not reasonably estimable, in part because we have not yet received third-party fraud reporting from the payment card networks. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual related to the expected settlement of the payment card networks’ claims because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods.  Litigation and Governmental Investigations

In addition, more than 80 actions have been filed in courts in many states and other claims have been or may be asserted against us on behalf of guests, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. State and federal agencies, including the State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. Although we are cooperating in these investigations, we may be subject to fines or other obligations, which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations. While a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses because our investigation into the matter is ongoing, the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. Further, we do not believe that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded a loss contingency liability for litigation, claims and governmental investigations in the fourth quarter. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Future Costs

We expect to incur significant investigation, legal and professional services expenses associated with the Data Breach in future periods. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. We also expect to incur additional expenses associated with incremental fraud and reissuance costs on Target REDcards.
Insurance Coverage

To limit our exposure to Data Breach losses, we maintain $100 million of network-security insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible. This coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure. We will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under the policies. As of February 1, 2014, we have recorded a $44 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, which partially offsets the $61 million of expense relating to the Data Breach.

Future Capital Investments

We plan to accelerate a previously planned investment of approximately $100 million to equip our proprietary REDcards and all of our U.S. store card readers with chip-enabled smart-card technology by the first quarter of 2015.
In addition, we may accelerate or make additional investments in our information technology systems, but we are unable to estimate such investments because the nature and scope has not yet been determined. We do not expect such amounts to be material to any fiscal period.
Effect on Sales and Guest Loyalty

We believe the Data Breach adversely affected our fourth quarter U.S. Segment sales. Prior to our December 19, 2013 announcement of the Data Breach, our U.S. Segment fourth quarter comparable sales were positive, followed by meaningfully negative comparable sales results following the announcement. Comparable sales began to recover in January 2014. The collective interaction of year-over-year changes in the retail calendar (e.g., the number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas), combined with the broad array of competitive, consumer behavioral and weather factors makes any quantification of the precise impact of the Data Breach on sales infeasible.
Fourth quarter sales penetration on our REDcards was 20.9 percent, up 5.4 percentage points from 2012. While the rate of increase slowed following the Data Breach, year-over-year penetration continued to grow.
We know our guests' confidence in Target and the broader U.S. payment system has been shaken. We are committed to, and actively engaged in, activities to restore their confidence. We cannot predict the length or extent of any ongoing impact to sales.",292000000,112000000.0,100000000,0:14-md-02522-PAM,	Armstrong Teasdale LLP | Morrison & Foerster LLP | Ropes & Gray LLP | Davis Wright Tremaine LLP | Robinson & Cole LLP | Hinckley Allen & Snyder LLP| Hartline Dacus Barger Dreyer & Kern LLP | Friday Eldredge & Clark LLP | Lightfoot Franklin & White LLC | Faegre Baker Daniels LLP | Maschoff Brennan PLLC,Zimmerman Reed PLLP | Chestnut & Cambronne PA | Heins Mills & Olson PLC | Milberg LLP | Hausfeld LLP | Robbins Arroyo LLP,49000000.0,63.54999923706055,60.2400016784668,56.38999938964844,59.72000122070313,60.0,58.290000915527344,58.70000076293945,60.0099983215332,58.54999923706055,63.93000030517578,59.06999969482422,67.51000213623047,74.63999938964844,65.0,65.08333333333333

The extent of the loss of company data was not immediately clear, although officials planned to ask all employees to change their user names and passwords on the assumption that many or all of them may have been compromised. Although company passwords are stored in encrypted form, hackers in some cases have shown the ability to decode such information.

Post officials, who on Wednesday learned of the intrusion from Mandiant, a cybersecurity contractor that monitors the company’s networks, said the intrusion was of relatively short duration.

“This is an ongoing investigation, but we believe it was a few days at most,” said Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti.

Officials said they saw no evidence that subscriber information, such as credit cards or home addresses, was accessed by the hackers. Nor was there any sign that the hackers had gained access to The Post’s publishing system, e-mails or sensitive personal information of employees, such as their Social Security numbers.

The company’s suspicions immediately focused on the possibility that Chinese hackers were responsible for the hack. Evidence strongly pointed to Chinese hackers in a 2011 intrusion of The Post’s network and in hacks against the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and a wide range of Washington-based institutions, from think tanks to human rights groups and defense contractors. This more-recent hack, Post officials said, began with an intrusion into a server used by The Post’s foreign staff but eventually spread to other company servers before being discovered.

In August, the Syrian Electronic Army briefly succeeded in redirecting readers of articles on washingtonpost.com to its own Web site. The group supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is battling rebels in a civil war.

The Syrian Electronic Army was also suspected in a “phishing” attack aimed at securing the log-in information of the e-mail accounts of Post journalists. The source of the attack sent e-mails to Post employees that appeared to emanate from colleagues. The e-mails directed recipients to click a link and provide log-in data. That information could have been used by an outside source to gain unauthorized access to the company’s computer network.", , ,ND,, , ,,,,,,,,379.0755310058594,389.93353271484375,399.51055908203125,431.74017333984375,407.85498046875,400.9305114746094,419.0876159667969,418.7734069824219,434.9184265136719,443.1057434082031,425.8187255859375,522.6646728515625,538.7130126953125,1.185,1.185

The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment compensation and other benefits.

JPMorgan said on Wednesday it had detected that the web servers used by its site www.ucard.chase.com had been breached in the middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported it to law enforcement.

 
 
Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that since the breach was discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which accounts were involved and what information may have been compromised. He declined to discuss how the attackers breached the bank's network.

Fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who account for about 2 percent of its roughly 25 million UCard users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the possibility that their personal information was among the data removed from its servers.

The bank typically keeps the personal information of its customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution. However, during the course of the breach, personal data belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain text in files the computers use to log activity.

The bank believes ""a small amount"" of data was taken, but not critical personal information such as social security numbers, birth dates and email addresses.

Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they believe there is any chance that such information may have been taken in a breach.

The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free credit-monitoring services.

The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards.

Fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other crimes have been committed. As a result, it was not issuing replacement cards.

The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach.

Officials from the states of Louisiana and Connecticut said the bank notified them this week that personal information of some of their citizens may have been exposed.

Louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits, according to a statement from state Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols on Wednesday.

Nichols said Louisiana would ""hold JP Morgan Chase responsible"" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of the citizens.

Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier said she was ""dismayed"" that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of the problem.

""JPMorgan Chase has some work to do, not only to assure the holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our continued business,"" Nappier said in a statement on Thursday.

The bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack, though the Secret Service and FBI were investigating the matter.

Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks.

Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all kinds have created new risks. In 2007, some 41 million credit and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen.

In May of this year, U.S. prosecutors said a global cybercrime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from automated teller machines in 27 countries.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,57.18999862670898,58.65999984741211,54.95000076293945,57.2599983215332,59.81000137329102,54.22000122070313,55.68000030517578,57.04999923706055,56.6500015258789,59.709999084472656,60.29999923706055,60.25,61.38000106811523,64.0,63.972727272727276

On November 30, the company's Icelandic website was defaced by attackers and subsequently taken offline. At the time, Vodafone did not believe that any confidential information had been stolen, and vowed to return to service.

The next day, however, Vodafone said on its Facebook page (in Icelandic) that despite its initial assessment, confidential customer data had, in fact, been accessed by the attackers. It apologised for this fact, and also advised its customers to change their passwords where they may have reused them elsewhere.

Turkish hacktivist group Agent claimed responsibility for the breach, defacing Vodafone's site with its group insignia, leaving the message, ""nsa, mola vakti"", and providing a link to SQL dumps of its customer databases.

The information has since been removed, and Vodafone is asking that others do not share it in order to protect innocent users' privacy.

ZDNet has sighted the stolen information, and can confirm that it contains customer names, phone numbers, email addresses, and social security numbers.

Some databases contained several entries showing common strings used in testing for SQL injection, interspaced with seemingly legitimate entries, indicating that this latest intrusion may not have been the first time that attackers had attempted to gain access to Vodafone's customer data.

Other databases contained the SMS history of customers.

Vodafone has confirmed that the SMS messages exposed were limited only to those sent from the Vodafone website and not via handsets. It also confirmed that the databases did not contain any credit card or bank details, unless that information was in an SMS sent from the website.

Vodafone CEO Ómar Svavarsson said that the company's security is constantly under review, and that although it conducts regular security audits, its attackers were one step ahead of them this time.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,37.80835723876953,39.76554489135742,38.03261947631836,41.56999969482422,36.45000076293945,37.5099983215332,35.040000915527344,33.389999389648445,34.459999084472656,34.34000015258789,33.560001373291016,32.919998168945305,36.54999923706055,421.667,301.524

(CME) has spurred a federal investigation and renewed concerns about the trustworthiness of electronic markets.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s owner said yesterday that its systems were hacked in July and some customer information was compromised. CME Group said there’s no evidence that transactions on its electronic-trading system or its clearing services were affected.

Although CME Group downplayed the significance of its incident, the danger to capital markets from hacking is underappreciated, said John Edge, a managing director at New York-based Nice Actimize who specializes in global trading and market structure issues. It’s likely there will one day be a large-scale attack that causes a major disruption, he said.

“From a statistical point of view, it’s completely improbable that it won’t happen,” he said. “The hacking community belongs to usually one of three groups: state-sponsored, organized financial crime or agenda-based activists. You’ve got some very well-funded, very talented, competent people whose job it is to breach security.”

Cybersecurity has been flagged as one of the biggest threats to markets and governments by industry groups and regulators. A study in July found that computers at about 53 percent of exchanges around the world were attacked during the previous year.

Santander and NatWest Banks are investigating a potential security breach of customers' email accounts, following the discovery of a new Trojan attack that has alarmed some recipients.

The malware, which was revealed by Belgian security firm MX Lab on Monday 4th November, uses a fake email from NatWest about a ‘Direct debiting seminar' to distribute Trojan software.

But when MX Lab CEO Peter Louies blogged to reveal the attack, comments back suggested the Trojan had been sent to private email addresses that should only be known to, and used by, Santander Bank and by the Government Gateway and NatWest FastPay service.

One commentator, ‘Fs Ck', said: “Interestingly I have had two emails to two addresses EXCLUSIVELY used with Santander in UK. I run all my banking in a non-persistent Linux live-distro and therefore this MUST have been from a bank security breach. I have around 500 different email addresses and not a single one of the others have had a similar email in five years. In fact no spam filtering and this is the first phishing email in five years. Santander – you have been hacked…”

Another commentator, ‘Steven K', replying to the possibility that Easyspace hosting might also be a factor, emphasised: “I also had this email on an account ONLY used by Santander UK; I've never had anything to do with Easyspace. What are the chances of Santander owning up and emailing everybody in their mailing list and warning them their email addresses have been exposed?  I would rate it at slim to none...”

A third commentator, ‘Chas', said they had received the spear phish to a number of email addresses - “but one of them has only been used with Government Gateway and NatWest FastPay”.

Santander's UK information security team was looking into the reports as SC Magazine UK went to press.  Meanwhile, a NatWest/RBS Bank spokesperson commented: “We take security very seriously and will investigate further. However, at this time, we have no indication that the bank has suffered a breach.”

Peter Louies at MX Lab said the ‘NatWest' email purports to come from Graham Nevin, a senior relationship manager based in Sheffield. The wording is plausible and a LinkedIn profile exists for Nevin.

The malware is among a spate of recent banking and finance-based attacks. Louies said MX had discovered other Trojan campaigns this week based on spoof emails from the UK's Inland Revenue and Companies House.

Elsewhere, security blogger Bart Blaze of Panda Security last week reported a new variant of the Caphaw banking malware being distributed via Skype. Caphaw, also known as Shylock, targets the customers of at least 24 major banks including Bank of Scotland, Barclays and the Co-Operative Bank.

Meanwhile, a survey published last week by Kaspersky Lab and Barclays found that 47 per cent of people have received bogus emails allegedly coming from a bank – and about 4 per cent of respondents admitted they had lost money to cyber criminals.

Peter Louies explained to SCMagazineUK.com that Trojan attacks come in waves. “You will have several weeks where we don't have many and other weeks where there are multiple variants. Recently spear phishing attempts have diminished and now we have more Trojans.”

Louies said he had not verified the comments to his blog which alleged that the malware was using email addresses created exclusively for banking accounts.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,10.649999618530273,10.829999923706056,11.279999732971193,10.850000381469727,11.010000228881836,10.449999809265137,11.199999809265137,11.260000228881836,11.420000076293945,11.90999984741211,11.640000343322756,11.75,12.1899995803833,,

Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyber attackers. Very recently, Adobe’s security team discovered sophisticated attacks on our network, involving the illegal access of customer information as well as source code for numerous Adobe products. We believe these attacks may be related.

Our investigation currently indicates that the attackers accessed Adobe customer IDs and encrypted passwords on our systems. We also believe the attackers removed from our systems certain information relating to 2.9 million Adobe customers, including customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to customer orders. At this time, we do not believe the attackers removed decrypted credit or debit card numbers from our systems. We deeply regret that this incident occurred. We’re working diligently internally, as well as with external partners and law enforcement, to address the incident. We’re taking the following steps:

As a precaution, we are resetting relevant customer passwords to help prevent unauthorized access to Adobe ID accounts. If your user ID and password were involved, you will receive an email notification from us with information on how to change your password. We also recommend that you change your passwords on any website where you may have used the same user ID and password.
We are in the process of notifying customers whose credit or debit card information we believe to be involved in the incident. If your information was involved, you will receive a notification letter from us with additional information on steps you can take to help protect yourself against potential misuse of personal information about you. Adobe is also offering customers, whose credit or debit card information was involved, the option of enrolling in a one-year complimentary credit monitoring membership where available.
We have notified the banks processing customer payments for Adobe, so that they can work with the payment card companies and card-issuing banks to help protect customers’ accounts.
We have contacted federal law enforcement and are assisting in their investigation.
We are also investigating the illegal access to source code of numerous Adobe products. Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident.

On Thursday, Apple took down its developer site, which is used by programmers who write apps for iPhones and iPads, for what it described as ""maintenance."" On Sunday, the company revealed that ""an intruder"" had attempted to steal data from the website.

Some wondered why Apple took so long to disclose the breach.

Dustin Curtis, the creator of the blogging platform Svbtle, tweeted: ""Q: What's the best thing to do after a huge security breach? A: Probably not this: tell no one for 3 days, then send poorly-worded email.""

Steve Streza, an independent developer, also appeared to criticize the timeline of Apple's disclosure. ""Thursday, we took down the site,"" he tweeted. ""Sunday, we got around to telling you all about it.""

Graham Cluley, a security expert, called the three-day delay ""disappointing.""

""If developers had known sooner that their email address and other details could have been exposed, they could have been on the lookout for phishing emails or other attempts to exploit the information,"" he said in an email to HuffPost.

Another expert, however, characterized the turnaround as ""fast"" and said Apple should be commended.

""In security, everybody will be breached eventually, but how fast you respond is what matters,"" said Marcus J. Carey, a security researcher at Threat Agent, a security firm. ""Some companies take weeks or months to act on something like this. I give them credit for acting fast.""

In response to the incident, Apple said in a posted statement on the site on Sunday that it was overhauling its systems and databases. The company said no customer information was affected and developers' sensitive data had not been accessed.

""However, we have not been able to rule out the possibility that some developers' names, mailing addresses and email addresses may have been stolen,"" Apple said, adding that it was disclosing the breach ""in the spirit of transparency.""

A Turkish security researcher, Ibrahim Balic, claimed that he was responsible for the breach in a comment on TechCrunch on Monday.

Balic wrote that he found a bug that revealed developers' information when using the site, and reported it to the company. As an example, he sent along user details for 73 Apple employees he was able to see -- though the flaw allowed him to obtain information on more than 10,000 people, he wrote.

An Apple representative did not respond to a request for comment, and it is unclear if Balic is indeed the source of the hack.

Apple has a complicated relationship with security researchers. In some cases, the company has punished them for the methods they use in order to expose security weaknesses. Balic said he was concerned that Apple might ""blacklist"" him because of the way he reported the flaws.

In 2011, well-known security researcher Charlie Miller developed an application that he believed could download malware onto iPhones and iPads. To prove this, he disguised his app as a stock ticker program and got it approved for distribution in Apple's App Store.

But instead of thanking Miller for his work, Apple revoked his app developer license, saying it violated the developer agreement that forbids developers to ""hide, misrepresent or obscure"" an app. He was also suspended for one year from Apple's developer program.

Apple's once sterling reputation for security has taken some hits over the past year, following several reports of malware infecting its products and services. In March, The Verge reported on a security flaw that allowed hackers to reset Apple customers' passwords -- knowing only their email address and date of birth.

Last year, security researchers found a piece of malware called Flashback that infected more than 500,000 Mac users and netted cyber criminals more than $10,000 a day through a security flaw in Java software.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,15.176785469055176,18.13357162475586,16.867856979370114,18.17464256286621,18.55535697937012,19.44499969482422,19.309642791748047,19.19178581237793,18.97357177734375,18.74785804748535,21.592500686645508,22.96500015258789,23.607500076293945,74.286,72.21052631578948

The breach did not affect any of the Nasdaq’s trading or commerce platforms, spokesman Joe Christinat said.

Users of the community bulletin boards received an email message from Nasdaq on Tuesday disclosing that user names, email addresses and passwords may have been compromised.

“We have identified the issue and we are in the process of upgrading and restoring the community. We will notify you as soon as the community is live,” said the email, signed by Bruce Hashim, vice president of online services.

Users were told to reset their password for the Nasdaq site and any other site where they might have used the same password.

The site itself was offline Tuesday afternoon. “We are currently upgrading the NASDAQ.COM Community Site,” a message on the Web page read. “We apologize for the inconvenience.”

Nasdaq lists and oversees trading for many of the largest U.S. technology stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG).

Increasingly, hackers have sought to break into seemingly low-value targets such as the Nasdaq's community site in order to steal the huge lists of user passwords. Such lists can be compiled into software that speeds up the process of breaking into more-secure sites that may contain valuable information.

Hackers also hit the Nasdaq back in 2011.

3.
Can you detail the cause, timing, and nature of your recent security breach? What will its final cost be to shareholders?

We recently became aware that an illegal intrusion into the Morningstar Document Research (formerly 10-K Wizard) system occurred around April 3, 2012. As a result, a small subset of our clients' personal information, such as names, addresses, email addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers, may have been compromised. The intrusion affected about 2,300 users whose credit card information was stored in the Morningstar Document Research (MDR) system. An additional 182,000 clients who had email addresses and user-generated passwords in the system may have been affected.

Earlier this year, we shut down the old servers and moved the data to a more secure infrastructure as part of a migration plan for MDR unrelated to this incident. We have taken additional steps to prevent unauthorized access to our systems to protect client information. We are also working with law enforcement officials and credit card companies as well as conducting our own investigations.

We take this matter very seriously and are working diligently to protect our client information and prevent this type of incident from happening again.

Protecting the integrity of our client information is of utmost importance to us. We have sent notices to MDR clients and reset their passwords. We have also encouraged MDR clients to be cautious about phishing scams and password protection. In addition, we have encouraged clients whose credit cards may have been compromised to monitor their credit reports and credit card accounts, and we are offering them 12 months of free identity protection through Experian's ProtectMyID™ Alert program.





At this point, we don't have any evidence to suggest that any of the information that was compromised has been misused, and we don't believe any other Morningstar products were affected. To date the costs involved in addressing this issue have not been material.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,78.06999969482422,77.37000274658203,76.44999694824219,77.8499984741211,79.5,80.08999633789062,78.38999938964844,75.12000274658203,83.12000274658203,77.25,74.08999633789062,70.55999755859375,72.55000305175781,,

The world’s biggest auto maker said the security breach didn’t compromise customer information because such data isn’t stored on the site. But it urges those who visited the site from June 5 to June 14 to install anti-virus software.

Toyota said unauthorized parties accessed one of its servers and tinkered with it so visitors to the Japanese home page were redirected to a different website that automatically installed a program onto their computer.

Toyota said it was the first time its website had ever been hacked.

For now, there are more things Toyota doesn’t know than it does know, including the origin of the hacking and what the installed program does.

Toyota, which first discovered the breach on June 14, issued a notice and apologized to customers for the inconvenience via a notice posted on its website Tuesday evening.

A company spokesman said the auto maker wanted to assess the scope of the hacking before notifying the public. It appears the attack was limited to the Japanese-language website. The vulnerable sections include various news pages such as “most recent top news” and investor relations updates. The investigation is ongoing.

Toyota said it had previously planned to upgrade its servers but hadn’t yet done so at the time of the intrusion. It will replace the compromised server, which has since been shut down, with a newer one with “heightened security” in July. Toyota declined to disclose when the servers were last updated or renewed.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,120.37999725341795,130.83999633789062,128.8800048828125,126.77999877929688,130.10000610351562,127.6500015258789,118.62999725341795,119.19000244140624,116.27999877929688,110.66999816894531,108.0199966430664,109.61000061035156,114.70999908447266,6.04,60.6108

Groupon Taiwan has just announced that it experienced an unauthorized cyber intrusion (read here: hack) that gained access to hundreds of thousands of user names and passwords. Groupon Taiwan has over 4 million registered users so the target was huge.

The company has issued password reset instructions for all users compromised in the breach which was confirmed May 19, 2013 but indicated that not all users had their data accessed.

“The members who log in Groupon Taiwan through individual Facebook or Yahoo accounts were not impacted in this breach incident, because Facebook and Yahoo store and secure the account information. Therefore, this incident only affected 1/10 of the total accounts,” Groupon Taiwan’s notification said (translation by Yan Zhang, idRADAR Staff). That leaves over 400,000 users searching for solutions.

While the passwords were encoded, there are many levels of encryption. Some are easier to crack than others. The notification did not specify the encryption method. Users who were impacted will receive notifications by this coming Friday. Those who do not get a notice will know their account was not touched the company said.

Groupon has been hacked before. In November 2012, Groupon Israel was hit. In that instance, the attack was politically not financially motivated however. Still, the financial info stored on social media sites can be hugely tempting. Just last month, LivingSocial was hacked exposing 50 million accounts and while the passwords were described as encrypted, critics said the security methodology used was not as strong as the company wanted folks to believe.

Victims of this hack should be concerned about the loss of their email addresses. With hacks of social media, the most valuable detail cyber thieves obtain is often your email address. A password is easier to change; usually folks will hold onto that established email creating a twofold challenge. First hackers could use that email address and the password if it’s cracked to try to access other accounts like Facebook, Amazon or other places where you do business. Then there’s the added risk of phishing emails landing in your Inbox. These cleverly crafted communications could appear to be sent by merchants or individuals you trust. Click on the embedded link and you surrender control of your computer to a hacker network. According to the recently released 2013 Verizon Data Breach report, phishing attempts succeed at an alarming rate and are almost 100% guaranteed if the phish is repeated five or six times.

It would be wise for all users impacted by this latest breach to review their password habits and make sure that same password—even though it was encrypted in this case—is not in use on other popular social media or shopping sites.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000149028114000024/groupon201310-k.htm,Risk Factors,2014-02-20 00:00:00,"We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could harm our relationships with our customers and merchants, subject us to negative publicity and litigation, and cause substantial harm to our business.
In operating a global online business, we and our third party service providers maintain significant proprietary information and manage large amounts of personal data and confidential information about our employees, customers and merchants.  Because of our high profile and the number of customer records we maintain, we and the third party providers are at an increased risk of attacks on our systems.
Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale, our plans to implement our entrance into the mobile payments space, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations and threats of cyber-attacks.  Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, this may not successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures.  In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, merchants or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. For example, in May 2013, a hacker accessed a database of our Taiwan subscribers containing usernames and passwords.  
As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.  Further, because the techniques used to gain access to, or sabotage, systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the correct methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks.  Any actual breach, the perceived threat of a breach or a perceived breach, could cause our customers and merchants to cease doing business with us, subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",0,,,,,,,139.60000610351562,153.60000610351562,175.39999389648438,190.0,231.0,213.0,208.1999969482422,225.3999938964844,216.8000030517578,205.1999969482422,167.60000610351562,148.1999969482422,121.0,10.0,10.0

Sprouts said Friday that the point of sale system at 19 of their 151 stores was targeted by illegal software between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29.
Credit card terminals at 13 Arizona stores and six Southern California stores were victimized by the software.
Within hours of learning of the situation, Sprouts said they replaced all of the card terminals at the stores in question. They are now working with the data security firm FishNet Security to strengthen their point of sale procedures at all of their 151 stores.
Sprouts has also notified federal law enforcement, and is assisting with the investigation.
Anyone who shopped at Sprouts at the end of last month is being advised to review their bank statements to make sure that there aren’t any fraudulent transactions.
Sprouts said they are sorry for any trouble this incident may have caused, adding that they take the privacy of their customers very seriously.
""There's always going to be a threat,"" said Sprouts shopper Mark Bejarano.  ""As technology grows, threats will continue.""
IT Security Specialist Francis Brown, a partner at the Phoenix firm Stach and Liu, said sensitive information is always at risk with the prevalence of malware and hackers searching for their next victim.

We discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later. However, our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information – usernames, email addresses, session tokens and encrypted/salted versions of passwords – for approximately 250,000 users.

As a precautionary security measure, we have reset passwords and revoked session tokens for these accounts. If your account was one of them, you will have recently received (or will shortly) an email from us at the address associated with your Twitter account notifying you that you will need to create a new password. Your old password will not work when you try to log in to Twitter.

Though only a very small percentage of our users were potentially affected by this attack, we encourage all users to take this opportunity to ensure that they are following good password hygiene, on Twitter and elsewhere on the Internet. Make sure you use a strong password – at least 10 (but more is better) characters and a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols – that you are not using for any other accounts or sites. Using the same password for multiple online accounts significantly increases your odds of being compromised. If you are not using good password hygiene, take a moment now to change your Twitter passwords. For more information about making your Twitter and other Internet accounts more secure, read our Help Center documentation or the FTC’s guide on passwords.

After surreptitiously tracking the intruders to study their movements and help erect better defenses to block them, The Times and computer security experts have expelled the attackers and kept them from breaking back in.

The timing of the attacks coincided with the reporting for a Times investigation, published online on Oct. 25, that found that the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China’s prime minister, had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings.

Security experts hired by The Times to detect and block the computer attacks gathered digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times’s network. They broke into the e-mail accounts of its Shanghai bureau chief, David Barboza, who wrote the reports on Mr. Wen’s relatives, and Jim Yardley, The Times’s South Asia bureau chief in India, who previously worked as bureau chief in Beijing.

“Computer security experts found no evidence that sensitive e-mails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied,” said Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times.

The hackers tried to cloak the source of the attacks on The Times by first penetrating computers at United States universities and routing the attacks through them, said computer security experts at Mandiant, the company hired by The Times. This matches the subterfuge used in many other attacks that Mandiant has tracked to China.

The attackers first installed malware — malicious software — that enabled them to gain entry to any computer on The Times’s network. The malware was identified by computer security experts as a specific strain associated with computer attacks originating in China. More evidence of the source, experts said, is that the attacks started from the same university computers used by the Chinese military to attack United States military contractors in the past.

Security experts found evidence that the hackers stole the corporate passwords for every Times employee and used those to gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees, most of them outside The Times’s newsroom. Experts found no evidence that the intruders used the passwords to seek information that was not related to the reporting on the Wen family.

No customer data was stolen from The Times, security experts said.

Asked about evidence that indicated the hacking originated in China, and possibly with the military, China’s Ministry of National Defense said, “Chinese laws prohibit any action including hacking that damages Internet security.” It added that “to accuse the Chinese military of launching cyberattacks without solid proof is unprofessional and baseless.”

The attacks appear to be part of a broader computer espionage campaign against American news media companies that have reported on Chinese leaders and corporations.

Last year, Bloomberg News was targeted by Chinese hackers, and some employees’ computers were infected, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s internal investigation, after Bloomberg published an article on June 29 about the wealth accumulated by relatives of Xi Jinping, China’s vice president at the time. Mr. Xi became general secretary of the Communist Party in November and is expected to become president in March. Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Bloomberg, confirmed that hackers had made attempts but said that “no computer systems or computers were compromised.”", , ,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/71691/000007169113000004/a2012form10-k.htm,Risk Factors,2013-02-28 00:00:00,"Security breaches and other disruptions or misuse of our network and information systems could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.

“Amazon, I have no personal grudge against you. I just found a opening and exploited it. So don't worry, others will get the same to,” the hacker wrote on Twitter.

The data leak appears to be legitimate since I haven’t found the same data sets anywhere else online and I can confirm that at least some of the username / password combinations are valid.

However, the information doesn’t necessarily have to come from amazon.co.uk. The account details could have been compromised by a third-party website, similar to the incident that involved Twitter accounts earlier this week.

The Pizza Hut website was allegedly hacked by a group called 0-Day and Pyknic, with claims that 240,000 credit card details were stolen in the process. Reports of the hacking event began to surface late last night.

Users who visited the Pizza Hut website were redirected to another page, which claimed that the website had been compromised.

A spokesperson for the company told ZDNet several hours ago that the company was still checking whether claims of the hacking were actually true.

Pizza Hut general manager Graeme Houston issued a statement moments ago, confirming a security breach.

""Pizza Hut can confirm that a layer of its website, pizzahut.com.au, was breached, with access gained to names and contact information, including email addresses,"" he said.

The fast-food chain has, however, refuted the stolen credit card detail claims. According to a company spokesperson, Pizza Hut doesn't actually hold any credit card information from customers.

""That one's a furphy,"" a Pizza Hut spokesperson told ZDNet. ""[Credit card information] goes through a third-party payment gateway.""

What Pizza Hut does collect on its website is information through its online membership application process. This includes names, contact details, home addresses, and what kind of pizzas have been marked as favourites by customers.

According to Houston, Pizza Hut is working with its website providers to conduct a thorough investigation, and has reported the incident to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

""The security of our online ordering system has not been compromised in any way, and our customers can continue to order online in the knowledge the ordering system is secure,"" Houston said.

Paypal hacked by Anonymous as part of our November 5th protest privatepaste.com/e8d3b2b2b1 #5Nov

— Anonymous Press (@AnonymousPress) November 5, 2012

Members of the loose hacking collective claimed credit for dumping 28,000 passwords online that they said belonged to PayPal customers. They said the  attack was part of a much larger hacking campaign, involving PayPal, Symantec, several Australian government sites and more, that was timed to Guy Fawkes Day, the British holiday commemorating a failed 17th-century plot to blow up British Parliament. Anonymous usurped Guy Fawkes as their brand and is often seen protesting in Guy Fawkes masks ever since the release of the 2006 film “V for Vendetta,” which featured a Guy Fawkes-inspired protagonist.

Although Anonymous’s claims went viral on Twitter and were picked up by several media outlets, it appears the attack on PayPal never happened. The 28,000 passwords actually belonged to ZPanel, a free open source hosting site. Anuj Nayar, a PayPal spokesman, said the payments company had been investigating the attack since Sunday night and concluded that there was no evidence any of its data had been breached.

A hacker who goes by the handle HTP on Twitter took credit for a breach on Symantec and released what HTP claimed were the passwords of Symantec employees on the Web site Pastebin. A number of media outlets attributed that attack to Anonymous, but the hackers denied any affiliation with the group. Mike Bradshaw, a Symantec spokesman, said that the company was still investigating the breach but that there was no evidence that any customer data had been compromised. Mr. Bradshaw did not clarify whether employee data had been compromised.

On Sunday night, a few other Web sites, including the home page for NBC and a Lady Gaga fan site were defaced. A group called “pyknic” claimed credit for the vandalism and made reference to Guy Fawkes Day, writing “Remember, remember the fifth of November,” suggesting a tie to Anonymous. Several media outlets attributed the attack to the group but again, the connection proved tenuous. The main accounts associated with the Anonymous collective did not claim credit for the attacks on Twitter.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,18.709999084472656,18.600000381469727,19.40999984741211,21.649999618530273,23.959999084472656,24.45000076293945,24.84000015258789,22.399999618530273,22.36000061035156,26.520000457763672,26.07999992370605,24.270000457763672,22.90999984741211,,

Details of about 37,000 accounts, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords and city details, were leaked, and the passwords have been released in plain text.

Dominos International operates in India through its master franchise Jubilant FoodWorks.

Domino’s India website was hacked using the SQL injection method and remote file inclusion, one of the most common methods for stealing private data from web databases. Through this, the hacker typically tricks the site’s database into revealing data that should be hidden by ‘injecting’ certain commands.

Govind Rammurthy, managing director and chief executive of eScan, says, “Once hacked, all the website can do is fortify its webserver and make some configuration changes that are not too costly. But it’s very hard to absolutely secure a website from the numerous attack tools available.”

Earlier this year, Microsoft Store India was hacked by a team of Chinese hackers who left a ‘black page’ tagged with the words “Unsafe system will be baptized”.

Besides the defacement, the customer database was also breached and usernames and passwords stolen, as there was no protection and no encryption on the site that stored passwords as plain text.

Independent security professional Ankit Fadia says, “Most websites, especially government sites, have little or no security protection. Second, these don’t even have dedicated security professionals to manage the website and keep protect these from targeted attacks.” Hacking a website has increasingly become a handy disruption tool for hackers. Recently, a Pakistani hacking group defaced more than 450 Indian sites. Fadia says most of the recent attacks on government websites were through the distributed denial of service (DDoS) method, which overwhelms a website’s servers and forces these to shut down. “This kind of an attack is also hard to trace, since DDoS attacks are carried out by a group of hackers and it is difficult to trace their location,” Fadia adds.

In a report, security solutions company Trend Micro estimated systematic attacks were carried out on at least 233 personal computers, and the victims included Indian military research organisations and shipping companies, and aerospace, energy and engineering companies in Japan. Baburaj Varma, head (technical services), India & Southeast Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, Trend Micro, says, “At least 30 computer systems of Tibetan advocacy groups have been attacked so far. The espionage has been going on for at least 10 months. This was not the only attack that was started and stopped; it is a continuous effort by cyber criminals to attack government websites in India.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,36.09000015258789,37.310001373291016,39.84000015258789,41.81999969482422,44.959999084472656,46.81000137329102,49.88000106811523,51.75,58.02000045776367,60.72000122070313,62.2400016784668,62.77000045776367,64.69999694824219,44.0,42.66666666666666

The F.B.I. said it had no evidence that this was true.

The hacking group, known as AntiSec — a subset of the loose hacking collective known as Anonymous — posted copies of the file on Sunday and claimed to have a total of 12 million numbers for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, along with some phone numbers and other personal data on their owners. They said their goal in releasing a slice of the data was to prove that the F.B.I. used device information to track people.

While the leaked identification numbers appeared to be real, security experts said the release posed little risk. They said that without more information on the devices’ owners — like e-mail addresses or date of birth — it would be hard for someone to use the numbers to do harm. And the actual source of the file was not clear. The F.B.I. said in a statement that “at this time there is no evidence indicating that an F.B.I. laptop was compromised or that the F.B.I. either sought or obtained this data.”

The F.B.I. has been a frequent target of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political causes rather than for profit. In February, Anonymous hackers intercepted a call between the bureau and Scotland Yard. But the frequency of such attacks tapered off after several members of Anonymous and a spinoff group, LulzSec, were arrested in March.

Apple’s unique device identifiers — known as U.D.I.D.’s — are 40-character strings of letters and numbers assigned to Apple devices. Last year, Aldo Cortesi, a New Zealand security researcher, demonstrated how in some cases U.D.I.D.’s could be used in combination with other data to connect devices to their owners’ online user names, e-mail addresses, locations and even Facebook profiles.

“A U.D.I.D. is just a jumble of digits,” said Jim Fenton, the chief security officer of OneID. “It is only powerful when it is aggregated with other information.”

Security experts said the identification numbers appeared legitimate, and one number in the file matched that of a New York Times employee’s iPad. “The structure and format of the data indicates this is a real breach,” said Rob Rachwald, director of security at Imperva, a computer security firm.

The hackers released only U.D.I.D.’s, a separate Apple-specific identifier and the device names that owners give their devices, like “Lori’s iPad.” Only a few identifiers were tied to e-mail addresses, apparently because the device’s owner chose to use an e-mail address when naming it.

On Wednesday, Apple released a statement saying that the company did not work with the F.B.I., or others, to release UDID numbers.

“The F.B.I. has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the F.B.I. or any organization,” said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman. “Additionally, with iOS 6 we introduced a new set of APIs meant to replace the use of the UDID and will soon be banning the use of UDID.”

Apple stopped letting app developers take advantage of device identifiers last year, to make it harder for marketers to track its customers as they moved from app to app.

The hackers claimed to have obtained the file from the computer of Christopher K. Stangl, a supervisory agent of the F.B.I.’s Cyber Action Team. In 2009, Mr. Stangl appeared in a Facebook promotional video titled “Wanted by the FBI: Cyber Security Experts” that encouraged hackers to get involved with the F.B.I.

He was also one of 44 law enforcement agents invited to participate in the F.B.I.-Scotland Yard conference call that hackers intercepted.

But security experts said the file could have come from a number of places.

“There are a million ways this could have happened,” said Marcus Carey, a researcher at Rapid7. “Apple could have been breached. AT&T could have been breached. A video game maker could have been breached. The F.B.I. could have obtained the file while doing forensics on another data breach.”

In their statement, the hackers said they would not grant any interviews about the breach until a reporter for Gawker, Adrian Chen, posed for his employer’s site, for a full day, in a ballet tutu with a shoe on his head.

On Tuesday evening, Mr. Chen complied. “There’s me in a tutu,” he wrote in a blog post with accompanying photos. “Get used to it because it’s going to be up until around 6:30 p.m. tomorrow.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,24.10607147216797,23.980356216430664,20.600000381469727,20.93535804748535,19.360713958740234,15.79714298248291,15.001785278320312,15.428214073181152,16.070714950561527,16.097143173217773,15.028571128845215,16.519285202026367,17.449285507202152,114.286,115.02542857142856

The automaker late last week filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Lexington, Ky., against Ibrahimshah Shahulhameed, a former IT contractor of Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America Inc.

As requested by the complaint, Toyota has been granted a restraining order preventing Shahulhameed from disseminating trade secrets or from leaving the United States.

""If this information were disseminated to competitors or otherwise made public, it would be highly damaging to Toyota, and its suppliers, causing immediate and irreparable damage,"" Toyota charges in its complaint.

Attempts to locate Shahulhameed for comment or obtain the name of an attorney representing him were not immediately successful. The complaint lists a Georgetown, Ky., address for the man.

Shahulhameed worked for GlobalSource IT, Toyota said.

Too early to tell

Toyota manufacturing spokesman Rick Hesterberg said Monday that Toyota continues to investigate the security breach and does not know yet what has happened with the confidential information, or whether it may have changed hands.

""We currently do not believe that any supplier data or our proprietary company information has been disseminated,"" he said.

He declined to discuss what defensive responses Toyota has at its disposal, if any, in the event that the material is leaked either publicly or to a competitor.

""It's too early to speculate on what-if's,"" he said.

Logged on all night

According to the complaint, Shahulhameed was fired on Aug. 23 and logged into the Toyota computer system around midnight that night. The complaint alleges that he stayed on the system until 6:30 a.m. the next morning, copying, saving and printing trade secrets.

Toyota's complaint accuses Shahulhameed of hacking into its secure Web portal, toyotasupplier.com, a data network where Toyota and its suppliers exchange sensitive information on upcoming vehicle projects.

Toyota alleges in the complaint that Shahulhameed improperly modified 13 software applications on the Web site.

""It will take days for Toyota's IT department to determine the full extent of its damage as a result of defendant's efforts to sabotage its system,"" the complaint says.

The court document claims that Shahulhameed was on the verge of leaving the United States for India, where he is a citizen.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,81.58999633789062,78.66999816894531,77.36000061035156,86.7300033569336,90.36000061035156,96.0999984741211,102.45999908447266,103.5999984741211,115.4800033569336,120.52999877929688,118.05999755859376,124.48999786376952,125.19000244140624,,

We quickly took steps to close off this access and began working with law enforcement and security experts to investigate what happened.

At this time, we’ve found no evidence that financial information such as credit cards, billing addresses, or real names were compromised. Our investigation is ongoing, but so far nothing suggests that these pieces of information have been accessed.

Some data was illegally accessed, including a list of email addresses for global Battle.net users, outside of China. For players on North American servers (which generally includes players from North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia) the answer to the personal security question, and information relating to Mobile and Dial-In Authenticators were also accessed. Based on what we currently know, this information alone is NOT enough for anyone to gain access to Battle.net accounts.

We also know that cryptographically scrambled versions of Battle.net passwords (not actual passwords) for players on North American servers were taken. We use Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) to protect these passwords, which is designed to make it extremely difficult to extract the actual password, and also means that each password would have to be deciphered individually. As a precaution, however, we recommend that players on North American servers change their password. Please click this link to change your password. Moreover, if you have used the same or similar passwords for other purposes, you may want to consider changing those passwords as well.

In the coming days, we'll be prompting players on North American servers to change their secret questions and answers through an automated process. Additionally, we'll prompt mobile authenticator users to update their authenticator software. As a reminder, phishing emails will ask you for password or login information.

Over the span of five months, he used accounts meant for professional athletes to steal Nike merchandise worth over $80,000.

A federal indictment explains the events that followed:

Case agents with the United States Secret Service and United States Postal Inspection Service received information from a representative of Nike that computer accounts provided by Nike to contract client-athletes had been fraudulently accessed and used to order Nike merchandise.

Through further investigation, case agents learned at least 12 Nike Elite accounts were accessed and a total of $81,419.58 in Nike merchandise was ordered and subsequently shipped to various addresses in Arizona, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida. The legitimate account holders confirmed they did not authorize anyone to access or place orders on their Nike accounts.
Stephenson found out Nike credited the accounts so athletes could order merchandise without charge. After learning how the system worked from professional athletes he knew, the former baseball player gained access to the Nike elite-athlete accounts and ordered merchandise from Nike by listing himself as a guest of the account holders.

A few months ago, the Secret Service showed up at his door with a search warrant. A search of the residence resulted in agents finding and seizing 231 pieces of Nike merchandise which had been fraudulently obtained through elite-athlete accounts. The value of the items recovered was only $17,057.

Stephenson gave a lot of the gear away as gifts and he even sold a small number of items on eBay, according to court documents. The rest he kept. The young man was indicted on one count of computer fraud and struck a plea deal after agreeing to help Nike plug their security holes.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,23.65749931335449,24.065000534057607,24.43000030517578,24.39249992370605,24.07999992370605,24.729999542236328,26.645000457763672,27.23500061035156,27.07999992370605,30.09000015258789,32.65999984741211,31.07500076293945,31.65999984741211,26.0,26.25

The company said it had suspended operations on the forums and ""immediately began an investigation,"" and continues to work around the clock to bring the forums back to life.   The bright side --- if we can call it that --- is that its security efforts appear on the face of it better than the companies who also recently suffered data breaches, notably LinkedIn, eHarmony, and Last.fm (Last.fm and ZDNet are both owned by CBS.)

The site said that ""hashed passwords with random salt value"" may have been stolen, but it goes above and beyond the practice of most companies that have suffered breaches in the last couple of months.

Many of the passwords stolen in previous attacks by the companies aforementioned did not salt the passwords, making their decryption easier.

Nvidia said it ""did not store any passwords in clear text,"" but publicly accessible information --- such as birthday, gender, location and so on --- may have also been taken, the website says. 

It will send all users to its forums a temporary password with instructions on how to change it, and all user passwords for Nvidia's forums will be reset once the system boots back up again. 

On Thursday, Yahoo suffered a data breach that saw more than 450,000 user account details --- including email addresses and passwords --- leaked online.

Included in the cache were Gmail, Hotmail, and AOL account details, sister site CNET reports, but less than 5 percent of passwords were valid.

Over the past two months, the hacktivists known as Anonymous have leaked more than 1,000 email addresses and passwords from Shell, Exxon Mobil, and BP employees. The hack, made possible by security weaknesses within some smaller sites owned by the companies, was intended as retaliation against big oil’s efforts to drill in the Arctic, TheNextWeb reported.

Since June 26, Anonymous has leaked 1,044 email addresses and hashed passwords online, encouraging people to crack them. According to @digitalsec4u, one of the cracked passwords included “exxonmobil,” NovaInfoSec.com reported.

“The energy companies that caused the Arctic to melt in the first place are looking to profit from the disappearing ice. They want to open up a new oil frontier to get at a potential 90 billion barrels of oil. That’s a lot of money to them, but it’s only three years’ worth of oil to the world,” Anonymous wrote in its email dump.

“To drill in the Arctic, oil companies have to drag icebergs out the way of their rigs and use giant hoses to melt floating ice with warm water. If we let them do this, a catastrophic oil spill is just a matter of time.”

So far Anonymous’ #OpSaveTheArctic Twitter campaign has collected about 1,500 mentions in the last month.

among other things, the name, address, credit card number and expiration date of certain 
credit cards used at the Hotel.
The theft of personal information was first identified in the beginning of April of this 
year, when InterContinential Hotels Group notified the Hotel that malware was present 
on the front desk computers of the Hotel. This malware had been unknowingly
downloaded by an employee when updating the Hotel’s software. The malware was 
active for a period of approximately ten (10) days beginning in mid-March of this year. 
While the malware was active, it is possible that your credit card information, including 
your name, address, credit card number and expiration date may have been exposed. The 
Hotel has reported this data security incident to the appropriate law enforcement 
authorities and has notified each of the major payment card networks (American Express, 
Visa, Mastercard, and Discover) of the incident. 
Furthermore, the Hotel immediately removed the front desk computers with malware and 
installed new computers. In addition, InterContinential Hotels Group immediately 
blocked malware communications generated from the computers at the Hotel to prevent 
further transmission of the malware or any further transmission of personal data. 
We are providing this notice to alert you to the possibility that the compromised
information could be used to commit identity theft. The fact that we do not know the 
location of this data that includes some of your own personal information puts you

The full extent of the breach is still unknown, the Journal reported today, and it's unclear whether fraudulent charges on cardholders have been racked up yet.

Global Payments later released a statement saying the breach didn't involve its merchants or their customers. The company said it had determined early this month that card data may have been accessed, and alerted law enforcement.

""It is reassuring that our security processes detected an intrusion,"" CEO Paul Garcia said in the statement.

Still unclear from Global Payments' statement is the nature and scope of the attack.

Still, MasterCard and Visa, whose customers could potentially be affected, have sent out warning notices.

A MasterCard spokesman told CNET that it was investigating the potential compromise and has alerted payment card issuers to the possible risk.

""MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this event and take steps to safeguard account information,"" a spokesman said. He added that law enforcement has been called in to look at the matter.

Likewise, Visa has also alerted its customers, and like MasterCard, stressed there was no breach of its own systems.

""Visa has provided payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards,"" the company said in a statement to CNET.

Global Payments processes payments from credit, debit, and gift cards between merchants and banks. Because it sits in this middle ground directing where payment information goes, an attack on its system would leave a lot of private financial data exposed. The breach was initially reported on by KrebsonSecurity. The site warned that far more cards -- more than 10 million -- may be compromised.

The estimated window of the breach appears to be between January 21 and February 25, the Journal reported.

More than 50,000 music files, most of which were by the late pop legend, are said to have been illegally downloaded.

Jackson's estate signed the biggest recording deal in history, worth $250m (£164m) with the company in 2010, giving it the rights to sell his whole back catalogue as well as previously unreleased tracks.

On Friday, two men who were arrested last May appeared in court in the UK accused of offences in connection with the alleged security breach.

James Marks, 26, from Daventry in Northamptonshire, and James McCormick, 25, from Blackpool, denied charges under the Computer Misuse Act and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act at Leicester crown court. They were released on bail, the Serious Organised Crime Agency said. They are due to stand trial next January.

The incident comes less than a year after the names, addresses and other personal data of about 77 million people with accounts on Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) were stolen.

The company warned it had been hacked last April when an ""illegal and unauthorised person"" got access to the information, forcing Sony to temporarily shut down the PSN, which allows owners of the consoles to play online games and rent films.

Private investigators were called in and Sony issued an apology for the ""frustrating"" security breach, promising it was taking steps to make its services ""safer and more secure than ever before"" in the wake of the attack.

Sony Music is home to a string of major artists, including Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, Foo Fighters and Avril Lavigne, and also distributes the music of Jimi Hendrix.

Its catalogue features what it calls ""some of the most important recordings in history"".

The company signed its contract with Jackson's estate nine months after he died from a drug overdose at the age of 50, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of debt behind him.

The deal also entitled the firm to use his music in computer games, television adverts and elsewhere, with profits from the arrangement to go into a trust shared by the singer's mother and three children.

Sony Music declined to comment on the latest alleged hacking incident.

Soca's involvement in the case comes after it shut down popular music site RnBXclusive last month, warning users that the majority of music files available via the website were stolen from the artists", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,21.3700008392334,20.809999465942386,15.729999542236328,12.649999618530273,14.199999809265135,11.239999771118164,11.3100004196167,11.850000381469727,11.329999923706055,9.6899995803833,11.510000228881836,15.130000114440918,15.229999542236328,,

Philips spokeman Steve Klink couldn't confirm whether any personal customer information or sensitive company data were put at risk.

""It isn't prudent to make any statements until we've gotten to the bottom of this and completed the investigation,"" said Klink.

The Dutch consumer electronics, lighting and healthcare group issued a short statement on its website on Tuesday stating that some of its small websites used for marketing might have been hacked on Monday.

This is leading to an approach involving further outsourcing, off-shoring, commoditization and ongoing reduction in the number of IT systems. The global increase in security threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime have raised the company’s awareness of the importance of effective IT security measures, including proper identity management processes to protect against unauthorized systems access. Nevertheless, Philips’ systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to attacks, which could potentially lead to the leakage of confidential information, improper use of its systems and networks or defective products, which could in turn adversely affect Philips’financial condition and operating results. In recent years, the risks that we and other companies face from cyber attacks have increased significantly. The objectives of these cyber attacks vary widely and may include, among things, disruption of operations including provision of services to customers or theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information belonging to us or other business partners. Successful cyber attacks may result in substantial costs and other negative consequences, which may include, but are not limited to, lost revenues, reputational damage, remediation costs, and other liabilities to customers and partners. Furthermore, enhanced protection measures can involve significant costs. We have experienced cyber attacks but to date have not incurred any significant damage as a result. However, there can be no assurance that in the future Philips will be as successful in avoiding damages from cyber attacks.

“Symantec conducted an internal investigation into this incident and also contacted law enforcement given the attempted extortion and apparent theft of intellectual property,” Mountain View, California-based Symantec said in a statement.

A group calling itself Lords of Dharmaraja, which claims an affiliation with hacker group Anonymous, has been publicly taunting Symantec for weeks in online forums, saying that it stole programming code for several Symantec products and was planning to leak it on the Web. Symantec said that code that was already posted is real, and was stolen in a 2006 incursion into its network, though most of it was for obsolete products, limiting the potential damage from a disclosure.

One vulnerable program is pcAnywhere, which corporate technical staff used to remotely control employees’ computers. Symantec said it has issued patches, or fixes for known security holes, for the product. Customers using older versions who don’t apply the patches face a slightly increased security risk, Symantec said. That means that hackers may find it easier to break into corporate networks that use the program.

Source code is valuable because it is a blueprint for how a company built a piece of software. Hackers who get their hands on it can hunt for weaknesses.

Security software is constantly probed for programming errors, and many legal, third-party programs exist to help security researchers find those flaws, without the need to examine source code, said Rich Mogull, chief executive officer of Securosis, a Phoenix-based security-research firm. That limits the source code’s usefulness in crafting attacks, especially for older products whose errors have already been fixed, Mogull said.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,17.530000686645508,17.100000381469727,18.309999465942386,15.9399995803833,14.770000457763672,14.119999885559082,16.870000839233402,18.950000762939453,18.030000686645508,18.850000381469727,18.850000381469727,19.649999618530273,22.280000686645508,,

The hacking of the system, which was revealed on Monday through a regulatory filing, affected a part of Euronet’s processing business that accounts for less than 5 percent of its revenue, profit and transactions, the company said.

“It was brought to our attention by the card organizations,” Euronet Chief Executive Michael Brown told Reuters by phone.

“When we heard the first little inklings of this, we jumped in, figured it out, got third parties involved who are real experts at this, and closed the breach... between our discovery and our shutdown, it wasn’t a long period of time.”

About the delay in disclosing the incident, Brown said it was not a severe breach.

“Maybe the reason a lot of people didn’t make a big deal about it, is just because the severity wasn’t as bad as some other people have seen...We had a limited amount of bad activity and we’ve been free and clear for over a month,” Brown said.


Expenses from the breach were less than 1 cent per share in the fourth quarter of 2011.

No claims or losses were asserted against the company in the fourth quarter 2011, Kansas-based Euronet said.

The company said it was working closely with international card associations and law enforcement agencies, but declined to comment if customers’ personal data was stolen in the breach.

Several companies including Citigroup, Sony’s Playstation network and Alliance Data’s Epsilon unit were targets of hacking attacks last year.

The affected business represents less than 5% of the Company's revenues, profits and transactions. Euronet took immediate steps to remediate the breach and ensure its impact was contained.

Bank card association rules provide a process by which loss and expense arising from such breaches is allocated among card issuers, acquirers and service providers such as Euronet. The Company expects that some claims may be asserted against it under such rules or under its agreements with acquiring banks. However, the Company believes that any liability under such claims will be limited by a number of factors including the fact that the majority of cards processed by the affected business were EMV compliant chip and PIN cards to which such rules either do not apply or apply a lower level of liability. Losses from fraudulent card activity appear to have been limited to magnetic stripe transactions processed on the affected systems. In addition, the Company maintains insurance to cover the financial exposure for response costs, losses by card issuers and fines or penalties from such incidents.

At this time, the Company is unable to predict the possible range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of claims against
it in connection with the breach, since no claims have been asserted against it yet and information concerning loss levels has not been communicated by the card associations to Euronet. However, the Company does not at this time expect the net financial impact of loss or expense from the breach after insurance recovery to be material.

The hackers posted a document on Pastebin to prove the success of the operation, but we’ve contacted them to find out the details and the main reason why T-Mobile is a target.

“They are known to be supporting the Big Brother Patriot Act law. Any cell phone company doing so I would see as a target,” said one of the hackers.

“One of the main reasons for the hack is because they are corrupted, but we also wanted to show how weak their security is.”

The hackers found SQL injection vulnerabilities on t-mobile.com and newsroom.t-mobile.com and managed to get a hold of the names, email addresses, phone numbers and passwords of the administrators and staff members.

“Look at the passwords, epic fail. All the passwords are manually given to staff via an admin who uses the same set of passwords,” the hackers said after analyzing the data.

We've tried to get in touch with the company for a statement, but the media contact page is hosted on one of the breached subdomains and it’s currently taken offline, which probably means that they're currently dealing with the incident.

TeaMp0isoN is one of the more active collectives from the hacking scene. They are involved in most of the major operations, such as Op Robin Hood or Op Free Palestine and even if they don’t hack too many websites, the ones they do breach are usually important. 

They are also the ones that breached the United Nations servers back in November 2011, proving that the information they obtained was not outdated as the organization stated after the incident was made public.

Update. Since T-Mobile's media contact website was down yesterday, we contacted Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent company, for details regarding the incident. 

They stated that only the newsroom was compromised and no other T-Mobile proprieties were impacted.

Zappos customers need to understand what is at stake, and be on alert for suspicious or malicious activity resulting from the attack.

In a letter to Zappos customers, CEO Tony Hsieh explains that the site was hacked, and that information including names, email addresses, billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers, the last four digits of credit card numbers, and encrypted passwords may have been exposed. The good news, according to Hsieh, is that the database storing actual credit card and payment data was not breached.


Account data for Zappos' 24 million customers has been compromised by hackers.
What Do We Know?
At this early stage, we basically know what few details Zappos has shared with it customers. Neil Roiter, research director for Corero Network Security, says, “We know that some 24 million customer records were breached.”

What Don’t We Know?

There is a lot we don’t know. Roiter explains, “We don’t know how the breach occurred, or when or over how long a period of time it took place.”

Those details may prove helpful for future reference – especially if the attackers exploited a zero day vulnerability, or found a unique attack vector that other organizations should be aware of to adequately defend against. As far as the fallout of this specific event goes, though, the proverbial horse is already out of the barn. Figuring out how the information was compromised won’t uncompromise it.

What Could / Should Zappos Do Differently?

Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle, says, “There’s almost no information about the attack method used to infiltrate Zappos so it’s way too early to point fingers or throw stones at their security practices.”

Storms points out that Zappos’ response to the incident seems to be appropriate so far. It has notified customers, and it reset all passwords to force customers to create new ones to replace those that may be exposed or cracked as a result of the breach.

Roiters agrees that there really isn’t enough information to go on to determine what, if anything ,Zappos may have done wrong. He stresses, however, that data breaches often go undetected for extended period of time.

Roiters says, “Companies such as Zappos should have technology in place that monitors activity on their networks and reports in real time on suspicious activity or activity that does not conform to security policy. The sooner an organization detects a breach, the more quickly it can contain it.”

What Should Zappos Customers Do Now?

nCircle’s Storms says that an incident like the Zappos breach is a poignant reminder for customers to make sure they use different passwords for different Internet sites – especially ecommerce sites that may contain credit card or other financial details. By using unique passwords, you can ensure the damage from a breach is limited to that one site or service.

Zappos has already taken the initiative to reset all user passwords. When creating a new one, users should remember basic password practices and make sure the password they choose is long enough and complex enough to resist cracking attempts.

Roiters says that customers may want to alert any affected credit card companies to be on alert, and adds, “It is advisable for people to use an identity protection service that alerts them if there is an suspicious activity on their accounts.”

It is fortunate the hackers apparently haven’t breached the actual credit card and payment data. That alone minimizes the impact of this attack to some extent. Still, the data that was compromised has significant value and could be used for identity theft, so be vigilant about watching your accounts for suspicious activity.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312513028520/d445434d10k.htm,Risk Factors,2013-01-29 00:00:00,"Some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.",0,,,3:12-cv-00325-RCJ-VPC,,,,181.66000366210938,191.3000030517578,182.25999450683602,188.4600067138672,222.92999267578125,214.4499969482422,218.38999938964844,233.19000244140625,261.26998901367193,244.17999267578125,222.9499969482422,249.19000244140625,272.73001098632807,220.0,218.74074074074073

While the passwords from the 548,774 Battlefield Heroes beta accounts were encrypted, they aren't entirely secure.
""Our investigation is ongoing, however it appears screen names and encrypted passwords associated with an early beta version of Heroes have been compromised,"" reads a short statement on the Battlefield Heroes site. ""To the best of our knowledge, it appears that no personal data was compromised – no emails, account history, credit card numbers or payment methods.""
However, all's not quite as rosy as EA makes out. While the passwords were encrypted with MD5, they are 'unsalted' and so not necessarily safe. Many of the MD5 hashes have already been 'solved,' so ne'er-do-wells might still be able to easily find your password.
You can use Dazzlepod's handy tool to check if your account was one of those compromised in the LulzSec hack. If you're on the list, you'd best get changing your password on any sites which shared the same password.
The Battlefield Heroes beta data is part of LulzSec's final release, which also included technical data from AT&T, e-mails of a number of private investigators, user accounts for a NATO bookshop, and user details for several gaming forums. With this, the group is calling it quits.
""Our planned 50 day cruise has expired, and we must now sail into the distance, leaving behind - we hope - inspiration, fear, denial, happiness, approval, disapproval, mockery, embarrassment, thoughtfulness, jealousy, hate, even love,"" says the group's farewell statement. ""If anything, we hope we had a microscopic impact on someone, somewhere. Anywhere.""
Over the past fifty days, LulzSec has targetted numerous parties, including Bethesda, Minecraft, EVE Online, and League of Legends, as well as the CIA, PBS, Sony Pictures, and the US Senate. Some were hacked into and had data copied, while others were simply knocked offline. The group professes support for the AntiSec movement, which calls for security exploits to be kept secret rather than publicised, arguing that sharing them does more harm than good.
Last week, a suspected LulzSec member was arrested in England. The group has denied that the man was their ""leader"" or even a member at all. Other hackers have claimed to discovered the identities of LulzSec users; this too is denied.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,21.959999084472656,20.450000762939453,22.459999084472656,23.32999992370605,20.600000381469727,18.440000534057614,16.690000534057614,16.709999084472653,15.539999961853027,13.119999885559082,12.279999732971193,11.68000030517578,13.329999923706055,,

information that has been compromised includes account numbers, names, addresses,
phone numbers, date of birth, gender and the date the account was opened, and only
affects CCJ cardholders. It has been confirmed that security information, including
Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and Card Security Code (CVVs) has not been
compromised.
CCJ immediately reported the inappropriate sale to the relevant authorities and the police,
and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.
While the risk of fraud is minimal due to the absence of security information, CCJ has placed
internal fraud alerts and enhanced monitoring on all accounts identified, and no unusual or
suspicious credit cards transactions relating to these customers have been detected at this
point.
CCJ is taking necessary actions to contact all the customers affected by letter and its

any fraudulent transactions occur, affected customers will not be held responsible.
CCJ takes the safeguarding of customers’ information seriously and will take firm action
against parties involved in the information theft.

As part of the spree of data breaches that the loose hacker movement Anonymous is calling AntiSec, the group announced Monday that it had penetrated a server belonging to the defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and released what it claims are 90,000 military email addresses, encrypted passwords and an assortment of data related to other companies and government networks. It also claims to have accessed and deleted four gigabytes of the firm’s source code.

“In [Booz Allen Hamilton's] line of work you’d expect them to sail the seven proxseas with a state-of-the-art battleship, right? Well you may be as surprised as we were when we found their vessel being a puny wooden barge,” reads the group’s statement posted to the Pirate Bay. “We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place.”

Though the passwords included in the leak are scrambled, Anonymous’ statement claims that the passwords are encrypted with an MD5 function that is widely considered to be insecure.

I’ve contacted Booz Allen Hamilton for comment but haven’t yet heard back from the firm. Update: the company writes on its Twitter feed that “as part of @BoozAllen security policy, we generally do not comment on specific threats or actions taken against our systems.”

Anonymous and Anonymous splinter group LulzSec have said that the campaign of attacks they’re calling “AntiSec” is designed to humiliate companies and agencies that fail to adequately protect consumer and employee data. It’s already hit targets ranging from the Arizona State Police to Viacom and Universal Music.

Booz Allen has already been involved in one Anonymous hack earlier this year. When the hacker collective dumped 71,000 emails from the cybersecurity firm HBGary Federal in retaliation for what it interpreted as an attempt to unmask key figures within Anonymous, the emails revealed that HBGary had worked with Booz Allen Hamilton to develop a response plan for Bank of America based on what the bank feared might be an upcoming leak of its internal documents by WikiLeaks. The Anonymous statement also paints the contractor as a revolving door of military-related conflicts of interest, and argues that the firm has been involved in mass surveillance projects.

“You would think the words ‘Expect Us’ would have been enough to prevent another epic security fail, wouldn’t you?,” Anonymous wrote in its statement. “Well, you’d be wrong. And thanks to the gross incompetence at Booz Allen Hamilton probably all military mersonnel of the U.S. will now have to change
their passwords.”

The group ended the statement by invoicing Booz Allen Hamilton $310 for its security audit. “Trolling is our specialty,” it added. “We provide this free of charge.”", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,18.950000762939453,16.069999694824222,15.050000190734865,16.229999542236328,15.609999656677244,16.719999313354492,17.450000762939453,17.65999984741211,17.520000457763672,16.649999618530273,14.869999885559082,15.300000190734865,14.760000228881836,21.0,21.0

No passwords or other personal information was affected. We are taking this incident very seriously. We quickly identified the vulnerability and shut it down, and are pursuing the matter with law enforcement. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.

When did this happen?
The attack occurred in two brief episodes – once on June 27 and once on June 28.

How does this impact those who were affected?
Users whose e-mail addresses were accessed may receive some unsolicited emails (SPAM) as a result. Their Jobs accounts remain secure.

How many users were impacted?
We do not know the exact number of individuals, but in total, roughly 1.27 million user IDs and e-mail addresses were impacted.

What is Washington Post Jobs doing about this?
We quickly identified the attack and took action to shut it down. We also have implemented additional measures to prevent against a similar attack in the future, and we are pursuing the matter with law enforcement. In addition, we are conducting a thorough audit of the security of the Jobs site.

What is SPAM?
SPAM, aka. Junk Mail, is unsolicited mass e-mail. One especially serious form of SPAM is phishing, in which e-mails may ask users for sensitive personal information, such as credit card information, bank account information, passwords and ID numbers. Often, phishing e-mails try to trick recipients into disclosing such sensitive information by fraudulently pretending to come from reputable companies.

How can I reduce or avoid SPAM?
Most major e-mail service providers have SPAM filters which help reduce the amount of SPAM in your inbox. Check with your e-mail provider for more information. In addition:

Avoid opening suspicious or unsolicited e-mails.
Never respond to or click any links in a SPAM e-mail.
Avoid giving personal or financial information in an email, especially credit card information, bank account information, passwords and ID numbers. (Washington Post Jobs will never ask you for your password or sensitive personal information over e-mail.)
What are some common SPAM red flags?
You do not recognize the sender.
The message is unexpected or unsolicited.
The subject line and/or e-mail contain misspellings or grammatical errors.
The message is alarmist or has a strong sense of urgency.
The message includes or references an altered, misspelled, suspicious, or bogus web address. (You should always verify web addresses before clicking on a link.)
The message requests money or rescue.
The message solicits personal information (e.g., password or bank account number).", , ,ND,, , ,,,,,,,,252.169189453125,231.3292999267578,191.02114868164062,198.78549194335938,205.1963806152344,209.87310791015625,227.5951690673828,232.024169921875,235.3111724853516,227.2930450439453,210.5740203857422,217.16616821289062,222.6586151123047,,

Earlier this week, the group attacked and successfully took down a handful of game industry websites, including EVE Online, Minecraft and The Escapist. All three sites quickly recovered and have been online since. Microsoft has yet to respond to request for comment on yesterday evening's alleged breach.

The company said last week that hackers who breached Citi Account Online on May 10 had acquired the personal information of about 1 percent of its 21 million North America customers, or approximately 210,000 credit card holders. But in a note posted to its website late Wednesday, the company revealed the new number, and said that it had known the number of customers affected was much higher as early as May 24.

The note didn’t indicate why the company hadn’t disclosed the higher number before, but The New York Times reports that the revelation comes after Connecticut’s attorney general and several other state regulators have opened investigations into the breach and begun demanding more information about it.

Citi said the information the hackers viewed included customer names, account numbers and contact information, but that Social Security numbers, birthdates, card expiration dates and security codes (known as CVV) were not accessed by the hackers. The company also said its main card-processing system was not breached in the attack.

The company began to notify customers affected by the breach, and re-issue about 217,000 new cards on June 3, but then waited until June 9 to disclose it to the public. In its note this week, the company listed the number of affected accounts by state. California had the highest number of affected customers at more than 80,000, followed by Texas with 44,000, Illinois, New York and Florida.

Citi said it has implemented “enhanced procedures” to prevent a recurrence of the breach, but didn’t elaborate.

The Times reported this week that the hackers easily penetrated the company’s network by using a commonly known technique called parameter tampering against a vulnerability in the Citigroup website.

The attack involves typing various strings of data into the address bar of the browser to gain access. The attackers used an automated tool to type in repeated account numbers into the address bar, tens of thousands of times, to access the account data.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,40.15999984741211,39.40999984741211,40.2599983215332,27.31999969482422,24.979999542236328,31.60000038146973,23.51000022888184,27.459999084472656,29.85000038146973,32.709999084472656,37.13000106811523,33.25,27.149999618530273,56.5,57.83333333333334

The electronics giant said the names, addresses, emails, birth dates, phone numbers and other information from PC games customers were stolen from its servers as well as an ""outdated database"" from 2007 which contained details of around 23,400 people outside the US. That includes 10,700 direct debit records for customers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, Sony said.

The dataset was stolen on 16 and 17 April, before the PSN break-in, which occurred from 17 to 19 April. Sony said that it had not previously thought that the data was copied by the hackers who broke into its systems.

A Sony spokeswoman in Tokyo admitted that the company was unable to predict where or how or when the next attack would come. ""They are hackers. We don't know where they're going to attack next,"" she said.

Another Sony spokeswoman said there was no evidence that the information taken had yet been used illicitly for financial gain. ""We had previously believed that SOE customer data had not been obtained in the cyber-attacks on the company, but on May 1 we concluded that SOE account information may have been stolen and we are notifying you as soon as possible,"" Sony said in a message to customers. The company denied on its official blog on Monday rumours claiming that the hackers who stole the PSN details had tried to sell back 2.2m credit card details.

Though the latest credit card numbers did not include the CVV – the three-digit code used to verify credit card transactions – the hackers will almost surely be able to use the card details.

The latest news will be a serious blow to Sony's management, already reeling from the enormous revelation of the problems with the PSN, which has been offline for more than a week. Though there have been no reports of management changes, it is expected that there will be serious ramifications from the security breaches inside the company.

The SOE network hosts games that are played over the internet on PCs, and is separate from the PSN, which connects PlayStations online.

The SOE network was taken down on Monday and Sony suspended its SOE games on Facebook because they use ""microtransactions"" and the sale of virtual goods, if subverted could be used by hackers to make illicit transactions.

The company said it will grant players 30 days of additional time on their subscriptions, along with one day for each day the system is down.

It is also working with the FBI and other authorities to investigate what it called ""a criminal cyber attack"" on its data centre in San Diego, California.

The revelation comes after Sony No. 2 Kazuo Hirai announced measures had been put in place to avert another cyberattack like that which hit its PlayStation Network, hoping to repair its tarnished image and reassure customers who might be pondering a shift to Microsoft's Xbox.

The PSN incident has already sparked legal action and investigations by authorities in North America and Europe, home to almost 90% of the users of the network, which enables gamers to download software and compete with other members.

On Monday, Sony declined to testify in person in front of a US congressional hearing, but agreed to respond to questions on how consumer private data is protected by businesses in a letter on Tuesday, said a spokesman for Mary Bono Mack, a Republican Congresswoman from California, who is leading the hearing.

Sony denied on its official PlayStation blog on Monday that hackers had tried to sell it a list of millions of credit card numbers.",http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313838/000115752311003320/a6733820.htm,2011-05-23 00:00:00,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313838/000095012311062283/k02583e20vf.htm,MDA | Risk Factors,2011-06-28 00:00:00,"Next, I would like to briefly address the impact on our financial results of the unauthorized access to the PlayStation Network, Qriocity and Sony online Entertainment network services that occurred this April, since there have been so many media inquires about this incident.

As of today, our currently known associated costs for the fiscal year ending March 2012 are estimated to be approximately 14 billion yen on the consolidated operating income level.  The estimated amount includes the following items:
 
●
First, there is the current estimated cost of the personal information theft protection program for our customers.  This program includes a set amount of insurance to cover a certain amount of identity theft losses that may be incurred by our customers in certain regions within a set period with respect to misuse of their personal information.  To date, however, we have not confirmed such misuse of personal information.
●
In addition to this program cost, there are:
  
Ø
Costs of welcome back programs that offer our customers certain services (such as games, music and videos) for free  
Ø
Customer support costs
  
Ø
Network security enhancement costs
  
Ø
Legal and expert costs, and
  
Ø
The impact on our profits due to a possible future revenue decrease.
 
These amounts are our reasonable assumption based on the information currently available to Sony.  So far, we have not received any confirmed reports of customer identity theft issues, nor confirmed any misuse of credit cards from the cyber-attack.  Those are key variables, and if that changes, the costs could change.

(IRVING, Texas) Michaels Stores, Inc. has learned that PIN pad tampering may have occurred in its
Chicago-area stores and that customer credit and debit card information may have been
compromised.
The company was contacted this week by banking and law enforcement authorities after some
fraudulent debit card transactions were reported over the weekend. Authorities believe the
fraudulent transactions may be linked to legitimate transactions in Chicago-area Michaels stores.
Consumers who have purchased items from a Michaels store with a debit or credit card are
encouraged to monitor their statements, report any suspicious account activity, and change any PIN
numbers and other account security settings. Consumers who believe their accounts were used
without authorization should contact the card issuer directly. More consumer protection tips are

Payment Card Terminal Tampering
 
On May 3, 2011, we were advised by the U.S. Secret Service that they were investigating certain fraudulent debit card transactions that occurred on accounts that had been used for legitimate purchases in selected Michaels stores.  A subsequent internal investigation revealed that (as of the date of this filing) approximately 90 payment card terminals in certain Michaels stores had been physically tampered with, potentially resulting in customer debit and credit card information to be compromised.

The Company continues to cooperate with various governmental entities and law enforcement authorities in investigating the payment card terminal tampering, but we do not know the full extent of any fraudulent use of such information.
 
On May 18, 2011, Brandi F. Ramundo, a consumer, filed a purported class action proceeding against Michaels Stores, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on behalf of herself and all similarly-situated U.S. consumers. The Ramundo suit alleges that Michaels failed to take commercially reasonable steps to protect consumer financial data, and was in breach of contract and various laws, including the Federal Stored Communications Act and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act.

The company, in a blog entry posted Tuesday afternoon, added it is still unsure if the intruder also obtained credit card data for members who have that on file with the service, which provides online functionality for the PlayStation 3.

""Although we are still investigating the details of this incident, we believe that an unauthorized person has obtained the following information that you provided: name, address (city, state, zip), country, email address, birthdate, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online ID,"" wrote Patrick Seybold, senior director of corporate communications for Sony Computer Entertainment America. ""It is also possible that your profile data, including purchase history and billing address … and your PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. … While there is no evidence at this time that credit card data was taken, we cannot rule out the possibility.""

Sony says the attack has led it to begin rebuilding the system. It expects to restore some services within a week.

The company is urging subscribers to be on alert for identity theft attempts as well as email, telephone and postal scams. (Users can contact the three major U.S. credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — and have their accounts put in ""high alert"" status for no charge.) It is also advising them to change their password when service is ultimately restored.

Sony's stock was down about one percent in after-hours trading. Click here for latest after-hours quote.

Analysts say they don't believe investors will punish the company substantially, given that this was an external attack and not the result of an internal error.

""Any time you have a break of fidelity like that, it's an issue,"" said Mike Hickey of Janco Partners. ""It's pretty clear that someone has taken an illegal action to make a point. So do I hold Sony to blame for that? No. But should Sony have better security to protect their subscribers personal information? Probably.""

So far, no hacker group has claimed responsibility for the attack. The rogue group known as Anonymous, which has famously launched attacks on both Gene Simmons and Hustler Magazine, was initially suspected, after it vowed in early April to target Sony after the company's legal action against a hacker who dismantled the PS3's security.

The group managed to disrupt the service with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack earlier this month. (Anonymous attackers, using software known as “Low Orbit Ion Cannons,” repeatedly pinged the company's servers. When done simultaneously by enough users, this can bring the site down — usually quickly and without warning.)

However, Anonymous denies responsibility for this incident, saying on its site, ""While it could be the case that other Anons have acted by themselves, AnonOps was not related to this incident and does not take responsibility for whatever has happened.""

While consumers impacted by the hack are Sony's first priority, the continued outage of the PlayStation Network is also impacting its developer partners (both internal and external).

The company released ""SOCOM 4,"" a multiplayer focused action game that is traditionally one of its biggest franchises, last week. Additionally, the eagerly anticipated ""Portal 2,"" which comes with a co-operative mode, also hit store shelves last week — with an integration of Valve's Steam online service into the PlayStation Network being touted as one of the chief reasons to opt for the PS3 version of the game, rather than the Xbox 360 version.

The company has reportedly vowed to help some of the game makers who are seeing their revenues dry up.

""Sony will be helping us retain key focus (PSN store promotion) for a few extra weeks as they understand how something like this can affect a small dev studio like ours,"" said Paddy Murphy, CEO of Open Emotion told IGN.

The outage and data breach could give Microsoft an advantage in the online gaming space, as its Xbox Live service has never suffered such a compromise. Unlike Microsoft, which requires a $60 annual subscription fee for access to most features of its Xbox Live service, Sony does not charge most users for access to the PlayStation Network. (A PlayStation Plus program is available, giving early access to demos, priority invitations to game beta tests and discounts on products in its online store.)",http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313838/000115752311003320/a6733820.htm,2011-05-23 00:00:00,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313838/000095012311062283/k02583e20vf.htm,MDA | Risk Factors,2011-06-28 00:00:00,"During the spring of 2011, Sony’s network services for PlayStation®Network, Qriocitytm and Sony Online Entertainment and the websites of certain subsidiaries have been subject to cyber-attacks.

Just this week, another quick service restaurant was hit with a data security breach leaving more than a dozen customers victim to credit theft. In Clive, Iowa, patrons of a local Qdoba Mexican Grill reported unauthorized banking transactions that range from several hundred to a thousand dollars.

Authorities suspect that the culprit somehow hacked into the financial clearing house used by Qdoba to process credit and debit cards. Fortunately, banks are recovering these victims’ losses. Instead of customers worrying about the taste of their food, they have to worry about the safety of their personal information.

So here is yet another example of a restaurant falling prey to a security breach. When valuable information is stored on POS systems, they become prime targets for hackers like the one in Iowa because they are less difficult than large scale attacks.

If merchants want to maintain the trust of their customers, they must take preventative measures to ensure the safety of personal financial data. Many cite that they meet the minimum standards set by the PCI Council, but that always isn’t enough. Merchants should utilize encryption or tokenization solutions that practically eliminate the opportunity for security breaches by taking valuable information off payment system’s network. These tools remove sensitive data that restaurateurs simply don’t need in the first place.

“We’ve confirmed the source of the vulnerability and shut it down,” says TripAdvisor co-founder and CEO Steve Kaufer. “We’re taking this incident very seriously and are actively pursuing the matter with law enforcement.”

According to Kaufer, only a “portion” of its members’ email had been compromised, and indicated that most members will not be affected by the breech. Those who are affected, however, “may receive some unsolicited emails (spam) as a result of this incident,” Kaufer wrote.
Kaufer did not indicate exactly how many members’ emails were stole, or when they discovered the breach in their security systems. (A company spokesperson tells ZDNet that the company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing.) But he does say that “data theft is becoming more common across many industries,” adding that TripAdvisor takes this “extremely seriously.”
Fortunately for members of TripAdvisor, which is best known for its reviews of travel destinations, airlines, hotels, restaurants and other tourist venues, the site does not collect credit card information. Kaufer was also quick to point out that the company also does not “sell or rent our member list.”
Trip Advisor is one of 18 travel sites owned and operated by TripAdvisor Media Group, which includes AirfareWatchdog.com, BookingBuddy.com and VirtualTourist.com. Together, the TripAdvisor network has roughly 20 million members in 27 countires.

Nasdaq OMX, which runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, said over the weekend that the breach by hackers was not related to the system that handles trades. A spokesman, Frank DeMaria, said the exchange would conduct normal trading on Monday.

Federal officials also said there was no sign that the trading platform had been breached.

Analysts said that the area that was affected by the intrusion was part of the company’s push to offer a wider range of services to corporations and expand its revenue beyond trading fees. The computer servers that run those systems are not linked to Nasdaq’s trading platforms, the company said.

The company said the breach was confined to a separate Web-based application, on which corporations can store and share information.

Nasdaq now handles about 19 percent of stock trading in the United States, compared with 27 percent by the larger New York Stock Exchange and its electronic trading arm.

The breach “will be a concern to listing companies and other firms doing business with Nasdaq,” said Larry Tabb, the chief executive of the Tabb Group, a financial research business based in Westborough, Mass.

Mr. Tabb said that while those products still represented a relatively small share of Nasdaq’s revenue, it had expanded them over the last decade to help offset the competitive pressures that can limit trading fees.

Nasdaq officials, he added, “are going to have to put a full-court press on solving the problem as well as a P.R. press to show the listing firms that they can be confident their data was not compromised.”

The intrusion occurred late last year, but Nasdaq OMX said it had delayed notifying customers at the request of the Justice Department.

Now, clients of the exchange will want to know more about how the company has enhanced its security as a result of the incident, said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group, a New York-based adviser to companies on listing their shares.

Customers will also seek information about what the authorities learn about the motives for the attack, he said.

Nasdaq OMX has said that it had found — and removed — suspicious files on its servers that could have affected an application called Directors Desk.

It said the Web-based tool is intended to help corporate officers share internal governance data, and the company said there was no indication that the hackers had gained access to data belonging to the service’s 5,000 customers.

Other Nasdaq services help companies analyze data, communicate with investors and file financial reports.

Law enforcement officials said the F.B.I.’s computer crimes branch was involved in the investigation.

While the public may worry about potential damage that could be caused by attacks on banks or stock exchanges, computer security specialists said the trading systems at the exchanges have much more extensive protections against hackers, who could want to try to make money through executing rogue trades.

But Gyan Chawdhary, a vice president for information security at the Markit Group, a financial services company, cautioned that an application like Directors Desk could hold inside information on earnings and other matters with potential to move markets.

Mr. Chawdhary said foreign governments could mount such attacks to learn how American companies handled critical challenges. But he said hackers were more likely trying “to gain company knowledge, which then can be used to make low risk, and high probability, investments.”", , ,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1120193/000119312511045348/d10k.htm,Risk Factors,2011-02-24 00:00:00,"Our systems and operations also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from security breaches, data theft, human error, natural disasters, power loss, fire, sabotage, terrorism, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events.

In a breach disclosure (PDF) sent to the state of New Hampshire, Hamilton Beach said the personal information of 24 of the state's residents could be at risk because of the compromise. The letter does not say how many customers worldwide were affected.

According to the letter, some ""hacker code"" had been inserted on a dedicated server that hosts www.hamiltonbeach.com and www.proctorsilex.com. The code resulted in the capture of customer names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and credit card information before that data was encrypted for transmission. The data was sent to two email accounts: hmtbccv@gmail.com and prosilexccv@gmail.com, the letter says.

Hamilton Beach says it immediately shut down the infected sites and notified customers, as well as the FBI, Google, and the affected credit card companies.

Warns of Data Breach

The American Honda Motor Co., has alerted Acura and Honda Customers that have established an online account for features such as Honda Financial Services or Acura Financial Services, of a recent data breach. Additionally, people who provided information to an authorized dealer during a vehicle transaction or Requested more information through an American Honda Motor Co., Inc. web site likely had information compromised.

The breach was a result of unauthorized access to an email list used by a vendor that the company uses to send emails to customers. The company said that no financial information was compromised, and that based on the information that was accessed, it would be difficult for identities to be stolen. The company has notified law enforcement and has initiated a investigation.

It was not clear, and the company did not mention, if the breach was connected to a similar breach that McDonalds recently experienced through third party email provider Silverpop Systems. Silverpop has listed Honda as a client so it's likely related. Walgreens also recently experienced a data breach related to its email marketing services.

The following email was sent to disclose the breach to customers:

Dear Customer,

American Honda Motor Co., Inc. recently became aware of unauthorized access to an email list used by a vendor to create a welcome email to customers who have an Owner Link or My Acura vehicle account. The data that was obtained included your email address, your name, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and User ID. Your password was not included and no other sensitive information was contained in that list.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. As a company, we believe that all customer relationships must be built on trust. That is why we believe it is important to inform you of this incident. You may be aware of attacks on email marketing systems, therefore we want to assure you that we take the safeguarding of your information seriously and that the appropriate authorities have been contacted regarding this incident. Additionally, we have taken steps to minimize this type of exposure in the future.

As a Company, we encourage you to continue to be aware of the increasingly common email scams that may use your email address to contact you and ask for personal or sensitive information -- Be cautious when opening links or attachments from unsolicited third parties. Also, know that American Honda Motor Co., Inc. will not send you emails asking for your credit card number, social security number or other personal information. If ever asked for this information, you can be confident it is not from us.

Again, let us reassure you that we are taking necessary steps to safeguard your personal information.

December 10, 2010 Dear Customer:

Genesco recently became aware of a criminal intrusion into the portion of its computer network that processes payment card transactions for its United States Journeys, Journeys Kidz, Shi by Journeys and Johnston & Murphy stores, and for some of its Underground Station stores. Immediately upon learning of the intrusion, we took steps to secure the affected part of our network. We believe that the intrusion has been contained and are confident that our customers can safely use their credit and debit cards in all of our stores.

The Company has notified law enforcement authorities and is cooperating in law enforcement's efforts to identify those responsible for the intrusion. The Company has also notified the major card brands of the intrusion.

The extent of the intrusion is not known at this time. The Company is continuing to investigate the intrusion, with the assistance of an outside expert, in an effort to determine the extent of any possible compromise of customer information. It is possible that the credit or debit card number, expiration date and card verification code contained on the magnetic stripe of some payment cards used at the chains mentioned above may have been acquired without authorization during the intrusion. We currently have no reason to believe that personal information, such as names, addresses or Social Security numbers, was acquired by the intruder.

We recommend that customers review their card statements and other account information carefully and immediately notify their card issuer if they suspect fraudulent use. Because we have no reason to believe customers' personal information was compromised, we do not believe that identify theft is likely as a consequence of the intrusion. Nonetheless, we are providing the Reference Guide below, which details some steps you can take to protect your personal information. For more information or with questions, please call our Customer Information Center at (877) 441-2998 or write to me at 1415 Murfreesboro Road, Suite 490, Nashville, TN 37217.

Cisco says it won't release details about where the data was stored or how it was breached but sometime last Thursday afternoon a vendor told Cisco that someone had made ""an unexpected attempt to access attendee information through ciscolive2010.com,"" the event Web site.

Interesting Data about Data Breaches

That lead to the general notification that Cisco sent to attendees and others who had been invited but did not attend. According to Cisco, details about less than 20% of those on the list were compromised.

Cisco says the breach was closed quickly, ""but not before some conference listings were accessed."" The compromised information consisted of Cisco Live badge numbers, names, titles, company addresses and e-mail addresses. ""No other information was available or accessed,"" according to the warning Cisco Live's event team sent via e-mail Thursday.

The same information is accessible to Cisco's World of Solutions partners, vendors that exhibit their technology collaborations with Cisco at public events.

Apparently the unexpected access attempt might have been made by someone who was actually authorized to access it, but Cisco isn't sure. ""As we cannot yet confirm the information was accessed by an authorized Cisco Live partner, we encourage you to consider the appropriate precautions to protect against any unwanted email,"" the warning reads.

Others besides those who attended the conference also received the notification e-mail from the Cisco Live 2010 staff, including Network World blogger Larry Chaffin, who raises questions about implications of the breach.

Cisco says it has taken measures to lock down the data and has no more to say about it. ""Due to security and privacy considerations, we do not plan to release additional details,"" a Cisco spokeswoman wrote in response to e-mailed questions about the data breach.


In general, if certain categories of data are compromised, businesses responsible for the integrity of the data must by law notify the people whose data was exposed. Cisco says this was not the case here. ""No, we were not required to do so but felt it was our responsibility to inform impacted attendees as quickly as possible,"" the spokeswoman wrote in response to an e-mailed question.

This is the text of the notice Cisco sent to the Cisco Live 2010 attendee list and those who were invited but did not attend:

""We hope you have returned home safely and are back into your normal routine after a busy week at Cisco Live 2010. 

""We are contacting you because on the final afternoon of Cisco Live, one of our vendors identified an unexpected attempt to access attendee information through ciscolive2010.com. The ability to access this information was quickly removed, but not before some conference listings were accessed.

""Cisco Live takes the security of attendee information very seriously and immediately elevated this matter to our chief security officer. His team completed a thorough review and as a result we believe your registration information -- specifically your Cisco Live badge number, name, title, company address and email address -- was accessed. No other information was available or accessed.

""Although these details are commonly accessed by our World of Solutions partners and often freely provided by Cisco Live attendees, we felt it was our responsibility to inform you as quickly as possible. As we cannot yet confirm the information was accessed by an authorized Cisco Live partner, we encourage you to consider the appropriate precautions to protect against any unwanted email. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience that may result and feel free to contact us directly at support@ciscolive2010.com if you have any additional questions or information.

The story, first reported by Gawker, detailed an extensive data leak that exposed the email addresses of thousands of high-profile iPad owners including CEOs, military officials, journalists, and politicians.

The website listed CEO Janet Robinson, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, film mogul Harvey Weinstein, NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel among those affected.

The wealth of personal data was obtained by a notorious group of hackers called Goatse Security which has garnered attention in the past for exposing flaws in the Firefox and Safari Internet browsers as well as publicizing problems in Amazon's community ratings system.

To obtain the email addresses, Goatse Security exploited a small 'convenience' feature provided by AT&T that allowed 3G users checking their data accounts from their iPads to avoid re-typing their email addresses each time. Aiming to make life easier, the function automatically filled in a user's email address which was linked to a type of serial number called an ICC-ID -- a unique identifier used to associate a mobile device's SIM card with a specific user.

Goatse Security programmers were able to access the email addresses by guessing a large number of ICC IDs based on their own experience playing with the device and pictures posted by iPad users. When Goatse provided AT&T's site with an ICC-ID as part of an HTTP request, the website's script returned the associated email address. Goatse wrote a program to quickly automate the process, harvesting at least 114,000 email addresses before notifying AT&T of their successful hack.

AT&T says it has disabled the feature that led to the problem, and for now the damage appears to be limited to iPads' ICC-IDs and the email addresses associated with them. Just how many accounts were exposed is still unknown, since AT&T continues to investigate the incident and told Gawker Media technology blog Gizmodo there is still ""no way of validating the number of addresses"" that were compromised.

This is not the first time Gawker Media has been front and center in an Apple-related security breach. Gizmodo made headlines in April for running images of an unreleased iPhone 4G prototype, which it claimed had been recovered from a bar. Steve Jobs later accused the website of extortion and buying stolen property.

For now, Apple remains silent on the leak and seems to be deferring the blame to AT&T which released the following statement to Gawker:

""AT&T was informed by a business customer on Monday of the potential exposure of their iPad ICC IDS. The only information that can be derived from the ICC IDS is the e-mail address attached to that device.

This issue was escalated to the highest levels of the company and was corrected by Tuesday; and we have essentially turned off the feature that provided the e-mail addresses. We are continuing to investigate and will inform all customers whose e-mail addresses and ICC IDS may have been obtained.""

The good news for users is the leak is relatively small and seems to be contained. Apple recently announced they have already sold over 2 million iPads since the device launched April 3.", ,,ND,, ,,,,,,,,,24.96999931335449,24.56999969482422,26.86000061035156,27.38999938964844,28.21999931335449,29.18000030517578,28.6299991607666,28.85000038146973,27.90999984741211,28.45000076293945,30.709999084472656,31.35000038146973,30.34000015258789,9.5,12.85375

Vincent Lim, monoprice.com’s operations manager, said the company took the site offline around midnight on Friday, Mar. 5, after it received e-mails and phone calls from several customers complaining about fraudulent charges on their cards that they had used on monoprice.com.

“A few of our customers recently reported to us that information from credit cards they used on the Monoprice website had been misused,” Lim said. “We promptly began an investigation with the help of expert computer forensic investigators to determine if any card data had been stolen from our computers.”

To date, he said, investigators have found no evidence that card information has been stolen from Monoprice’s computer network. The site is now allowing customers to browse products, but Monoprice won’t be taking any new orders until the investigation is completed, Lim said.

“We want to ensure that there is no security vulnerability in any part of our computer network system. We notified local and federal law enforcement agencies, our credit card processing business partners, and all credit card companies that some of our customers reported concerns regarding their card information to us,” the company said in a statement that now frames the top of its Web site. “We also advised these entities that we are working with outside security specialists to determine if there was breach of our computer system. We will post additional information when it is available.”

How many victims? Unknown, but the breach affects a “small percentage of our WHR customers,” the company said in an open letter to customers.

What type of personal information? Cardholder names and card numbers, expiration dates and other data from the card's magnetic stripe.

Birth dates, Social Security numbers, addresses or other personally identifying information were not kept by the hotels and are not part of the compromise.

What happened? In late January, WHR discovered that a sophisticated hacker broke into the computer systems of one of its data centers. By going through the centralized network connections, the hacker was able to access and download sensitive customer information from several, but not all, of the WHR hotels.

Details: Last year, WHR suffered a separate data breach after a hacker accessed its computer systems and downloaded information from several WHR properties.

Quote: “We deeply regret that this incident occurred and are doing everything we can to notify our customers directly, to address and remedy the problem,” WHR's open letter to customers states.

What was the response?  The company ensured the hack was immediately caught and stopped, and the chain retained an investigator to assess the problem and help the company improve security. In addition, each impacted property is being investigated by a firm specializing in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to assess and improve compliance.

WHR is working to notify affected individuals and plans to offer them free credit monitoring services. WHR has also notified the U.S. Secret Service, as well as several states' attorneys general offices with information about the breach.

In its annual report filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Intel confirmed that it had been hit in January.

""We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems by, for example, masquerading as authorized users or surreptitious introduction of software,"" read the 10-K filing. ""These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company, its products, or end users, are sometimes successful. One recent and sophisticated incident occurred in January 2010 around the same time as the recently publicized security incident reported by Google.""

Intel did not reveal whether the attacks resulted in intruders accessing or stealing confidential company information. ""We treat that information as highly confidential, just as we do about how we handle our defenses,"" said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy today. For its part, Google acknowledged that hackers had stolen data when it broke the news that it and other major Western corporations had been struck with what it called ""highly sophisticated and targeted"" attacks.

Mulloy denied there was any connection between the attacks against Google and those on his own company. ""The timing was coincidental,"" he said today, claiming that the attempt was added to the 10-K filing to alert investors of a risk to Intel. ""This isn't a reflection of any marked increase"" in attacks, he said, adding that Intel is regularly targeted by hackers.

Only a few companies have joined Google in admitting that they were hit with attacks that relied on an exploit of a then-unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer 6. Adobe Systems Inc. was one corporation that stepped forward, while Juniper Networks Inc. and Symantec Corp. said they were investigating suspicious activity on their networks. News accounts at the time reported that Yahoo, Dow Chemical and Northrop Grumman were also attacked.

Although Google has maintained that around 30 companies were hit by Chinese hackers, other researchers have said that their investigations have uncovered a much larger number of victims.

A report last week in The New York Times implicated computers at a pair of Chinese schools; those schools, however, have denied playing any part in the attacks.", ,,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000095012310015237/f54119e10vk.htm,Risk Factors,2010-02-22 00:00:00,"We may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse, which could result in third-party claims and harm our business and results of operations.

Although there was speculation that the 2006 incident involved a hack of their POS system, I don’t recall ever seeing any definitive statement as to how the cyberthieves acquired the customer data. I wonder what happened this time.

Internal documents reveal for the first time that the nation's largest retailer was among the earliest targets of a wave of cyberattacks that went after the bank-card processing systems of brick-and-mortar stores around the United States beginning in 2005. The details of the breach, and the company's challenges in reconstructing what happened, shed new light on the vulnerable state of retail security at the time, despite card-processing security standards that had been in place since 2001.

In response to inquiries from Wired.com, the company acknowledged the hack attack, which it calls an ""internal issue."" Because no sensitive customer data was stolen, Wal-Mart had no obligation to disclose the breach publicly.

Wal-Mart had a number of security vulnerabilities at the time of the attack, according to internal security assessments seen by Wired.com, and acknowledged as genuine by Wal-Mart. For example, at least four years' worth of customer purchasing data, including names, card numbers and expiration dates, were housed on company networks in unencrypted form. Wal-Mart says it was in the process of dramatically improving the security of its transaction data, and in 2006 began encrypting the credit card numbers and other customer information, and making other important security changes.

""Wal-Mart ... really made every effort to segregate the data, to make separate networks, to encrypt it fully from start to finish through the transmission, "" says Wal-Mart's Chief Privacy Officer Zoe Strickland. ""And not just in one area but across the different uses of credit card systems.""

Wal-Mart uncovered the breach in November 2006, after a fortuitous server crash led administrators to a password-cracking tool that had been surreptitiously installed on one of its servers. Wal-Mart's initial probe traced the intrusion to a compromised VPN account, and from there to a computer in Minsk, Belarus.

The discovery set off an investigation that swept in outside security consultants and corporate attorneys to determine what the hackers had touched, and whether the company was required to report the intrusion, and to whom, the documents show. Wal-Mart says it notified federal law enforcement agents, who were working on other ongoing investigations involving similar breaches.

At the time, attacks featuring a similar MO were occurring at TJX, Dave & Buster's restaurants and other companies, which ultimately resulted in more than 100 million cards being compromised. Albert Gonzalez, a 28-year-old Miami man, pleaded guilty this month to carrying out many of those breaches with other hackers, and is facing unresolved charges for the remainders.

The Wal-Mart intrusion began unraveling on Nov. 5, 2006, when the company's IT security group was brought in to investigate the server crash.

Wal-Mart has thousands of servers nationwide, and any one of them crashing would ordinarily be a routine event. But this one raised a red flag. Someone had installed L0phtcrack, a password-cracking tool, onto the system, which crashed the server when the intruder tried to launch the program.

Investigators found that the tool had been installed remotely by someone using a generic network administrator account. The intruder had reached the machine through a VPN account assigned to a former Wal-Mart worker in Canada, which administrators had failed to close after the worker left the company. The day the server crashed, the intruder had been connected to Wal-Mart’s network for about seven hours, originating from an IP address in Minsk, the documents show.

The security team disabled the compromised VPN account, but the intruder, who should have realized the jig was up, came back in through another account belonging to a different Canadian employee. When that VPN account was closed, the intruder grabbed yet a third account while Wal-Mart workers were still scrambling to get a fix on the scope of the breach.

When Wal-Mart reviewed its VPN logs, it found that the activity had begun at least as early as June 2005, according to memos written by Wal-Mart employees during the initial stage of the investigation. The company's server logs recorded only unsuccessful log-in attempts, not successful ones, frustrating a detailed analysis.

Wal-Mart declined to respond to questions about the initial date of the attack, the server logging or the conclusions it reached in its final report, which Wired.com has not seen.

Nonetheless, Wal-Mart's security team was able to identify ""over 800 machines that the attacker either tried to brute force or actually made a successful connection,"" according to a Nov. 10, 2006 e-mail summarizing the early investigation.

Many computers the hackers targeted belonged to company programmers, the documents show. Wal-Mart at the time produced some of its own software, because the company couldn’t find off-the-shelf applications that scaled to its size, according to a source who was involved with the investigation. One team of programmers was tasked with coding the company’s point-of-sale system for processing credit and debit card transactions. This was the team the intruders targeted.

""They weren’t port scanning, they weren’t ping tracing, they weren’t groping blindly in the dark trying to find a nugget,"" says the investigator. ""They knew what they were going for and they were all over it – point-of-sale.”

The intruders' interest in Wal-Mart's point-of-sale system is consistent with large data breaches that occurred at other companies around the same time. In the spring of 2005, associates of TJX hacker Albert Gonzales hacked into the point-of-sale system of a Marshall's clothing store in Minnesota. The hackers pointed an antenna at the store to grab data as it streamed over the store's vulnerable Wi-Fi network, then used the data to gain access to the central transaction database of TJX, Marshall's parent company.

Similarly, in mid-2007, Gonzalez's gang gained access to point-of-sale servers at Dave & Buster's restaurants and installed packet sniffers to siphon card data as it was transmitted to corporate computers and others for authorization. According to court documents, the hackers' MO included doing reconnaissance of retailers to determine the point-of-sale systems they used and map their network setups. (There's no evidence Wired.com has seen linking Gonzalez to the Wal-Mart breach.)

In the case of Wal-Mart, one of the documents that flew off to Minsk from a programmer's machine was titled ""POS Store Systems Technical Specifications TLOG Encryption and Financial Flows Draft 03/04/2006"" – essentially a flow chart that would have mapped out Wal-Mart’s transaction process, the source says, from the moment a customer swipes his credit or debit card in a store’s card reader, to the point the digital data crosses the network to be authenticated by a card issuer.

The hackers also stole or accessed files containing point-of-sale source code and executables, as well as additional proprietary documentation detailing the company’s transaction processing network. A partial list seen by Wired.com includes documentation on a company database, a file connected to a point-of-sale simulator, debugging files, a telnet capture, a bash history file and a sign-on log.

The documents show no evidence that files containing customer information were breached in the attack.

At the time Wal-Mart discovered the breach, it had been encrypting its transaction data for at least three months. It began to do so after a security audit performed for the company in December 2005 found that customer data was poorly protected.

Wal-Mart commissioned the probe from security auditors at CyberTrust as part of its efforts to become compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards that were established in 2001. Enforced by credit card issuer Visa, top-tier companies such as Wal-Mart were theoretically required to be in compliance with the standards by mid-2004. Wal-Mart says it received a number of deadline extensions.

CyberTrust examined networks at five Wal-Mart locations: three Wal-Mart stores in Missouri and Oklahoma, and two other Wal-Mart-owned businesses – a Sam’s Club store in Missouri and a Neighborhood Market in Arkansas, according to a report the auditors wrote.

The assessment lasted six days, during which CyberTrust found numerous problems. Each of the five stores, for example, housed complete backup copies of transaction logs on network-connected UNIX servers, which included at least four years' worth of unencrypted credit card numbers, cardholder names and expiration dates from purchases at the stores.

The auditors also discovered that servers, transaction processing systems, and other network-connected devices handling sensitive information used the same usernames and passwords across every Wal-Mart store nationwide. In some cases, the passwords could be easily guessed. A hacker or malicious insider who compromised a point-of-sale controller or in-store card processor at one store, could “access the same device at every Wal-Mart store nationwide,” CyberTrust wrote.

Finally, CyberTrust found sensitive customer information stored unencrypted on pharmacy computers at four of the stores, including customer names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, genders, credit card numbers and expiration dates. “A long-term, undetected compromise of Wal-Mart RXP system could allow a virtually endless supply of customers’ names, addresses, and Social Security numbers – the basic ingredients for identity theft,” CyberTrust wrote in its report. ""Wal-Mart runs the risk of ... losing not only the sensitive information, but also their customers’ hard earned trust,"" the auditors added.

The report was dated Jan. 9, 2006, 10 months before Wal-Mart discovered the breach.

Strickland says the company took the report to heart and ""put a massive amount of energy and expertise"" into addressing the risks to customer data, and became certified as PCI-compliant in August 2006 by VeriSign.

After it discovered the breach in November 2006, the company turned over memory dumps and at least 31 forensic images of machines and servers to Stroz Friedberg, a forensic investigations firm, for further analyses. E-mails exchanged by team members eight days after the intrusion was detected show the company furiously searching firewall and intrusion detection logs for suspicious activity. The e-mails also discuss shutting down the entire Nortel VPN network the intruder used, ordering RSA security tokens to authenticate users to the network, and increasing logging retention on servers.

On Nov. 16, one team member sent an unencrypted e-mail update to other employees and was harshly rebuked by a senior security manager who warned them to communicate only through e/pop, a secure instant messaging system.

“Guys.... time out here,” he wrote. “What was the first thing I discussed in our meeting about communications protocol concerning this project? Get Epop up, installed, and running today!”

The company's internal investigators found evidence potentially linking the attack to a suspected breach at a Wal-Mart division a year earlier. The forensic trail showed that the machine in Belarus that breached Wal-Mart's VPN had tried to log on to a machine belonging to Sam's Club, Wal-Mart's membership store chain, in 2005.

This finding was potentially significant, because Sam's Club had been suspected in 2005 of spilling credit card data in a breach. Late that year, MasterCard and Visa informed Wal-Mart about a cluster of fraudulent charges on credit cards that had been used at Sam’s Club gas stations. A press release issued by Sam's Club at the time warned that intruders might have gained access to 600 cards used at the pumps between Sept. 21 and Oct. 2, 2005. But the company assured consumers that “the electronic systems and databases used inside its stores and for samsclub.com are not involved"" and now says that after investigating the issue, it never found any evidence of a breach at its gas pumps or in its stores.

The company also says the Sam's Club investigation and the 2006 breach are not connected.

""The Sam's Club matter has been closed for some time and is not related to the other matter you're asking about,"" said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Michelle Bradford.

Internal documents show that Sam's Club suffered the same types of vulnerabilities as the rest of Wal-Mart's empire, and that logging was inadequate to completely rule out a breach. An audit by VeriSign at the time found that Sam's Club's firewall and intrusion-detection logs were configured to record only ""spotty and inconsistent"" data, and that operating systems lacked the latest security patches.

""The level of vulnerability identified . . . would leave these systems open to compromise from a number of different attacks,"" wrote VeriSign in a report. But ""due to the level of logging enabled on these systems, which did not capture much information, it was not possible to determine if any of these vulnerabilities were attacked."" In the report, which Wal-Mart submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in February 2006, nine months before it discovered the breach in its main network, VeriSign concluded that although it had found no point of compromise in the Sam's Club system, the company's logs didn't contain sufficient information ""to identify or rule out a specific point of compromise.""

Wal-Mart says that the security issues raised in all of these reports have been addressed and that since the company became PCI compliant in August 2006, it has been commissioning PCI audits every six months – twice the frequency required by PCI standards.

""Every item [in the reports] that had a PCI vulnerability was remediated,"" says Strickland.

PCI certification doesn't guarantee the security of bank card data – numerous companies that experienced serious bank card breaches in recent years were certified PCI compliant at the time they were breached. There is no evidence, however, that Wal-Mart suffered a sizable breach of credit or debit card data from either Sam's Club in 2005 or from its main network in 2006.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,49.61000061035156,53.2400016784668,54.6500015258789,54.72999954223633,52.9000015258789,53.9000015258789,55.02000045776367,52.47999954223633,50.86000061035156,50.11999893188477,50.43000030517578,52.209999084472656,53.91999816894531,59.0,58.8

The FTC alleges that these failures led to fraudulent charges on consumers’ accounts, millions of dollars in fraud loss, and the export of hundreds of thousands of consumers’ payment card account information to an Internet domain address registered in Russia.

The case against Wyndham is part of the FTC’s ongoing efforts to make sure that companies live up to the promises they make about privacy and data security.

In its complaint, the FTC alleges that Wyndham’s privacy policy misrepresented the security measures that the company and its subsidiaries took to protect consumers’ personal information, and that its failure to safeguard personal information caused substantial consumer injury.  The agency charged that the security practices were unfair and deceptive and violated the FTC Act.  

Wyndham and its subsidiaries license the Wyndham name to approximately 90 independently-owned hotels, under franchise and management agreements.

Since 2008 Wyndham has claimed, on its Wyndham Hotels and Resorts subsidiary’s website that, “We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of individual-specific (personally identifiable) information collected about guests, callers to our central reservation
centers, visitors to our Web sites, and members participating in our Loyalty Program …”

According to the FTC’s complaint, the repeated security failures exposed consumers’ personal data to unauthorized access.  Wyndham and its subsidiaries failed to take security measures such as complex user IDs and passwords, firewalls and network segmentation between the hotels and the corporate network, the agency alleged.  In addition, the defendants allowed improper software configurations which resulted in the storage of sensitive payment card information in clear readable text.

Each Wyndham-branded hotel has its own property management computer system that handles payment card transactions and stores information on such things as payment card account numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.  According to the FTC, in the first breach in April 2008, intruders gained access to a Phoenix, Arizona Wyndham-branded hotel's local computer network that was connected to the Internet and the corporate network of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts.

Because of Wyndham’s inadequate security procedures, the breach gave the intruders  access to the corporate network of Wyndham’s Hotels and Resorts subsidiary, and the property management system servers of 41Wyndham-branded hotels.  This access enabled the intruders to:

install “memory-scraping” malware on numerous Wyndham-branded hotels' property management system servers.
access files on Wyndham-branded hotels’ property management system servers that contained payment card account information for large numbers of consumers, which was improperly stored in clear readable text.
Ultimately, the breach led to the compromise of more than 500,000 payment card accounts, and the export hundreds of thousands of consumers’ payment card account numbers to a domain registered in Russia.

Even after faulty security led to one breach, the FTC charged, Wyndham still failed to remedy known security vulnerabilities; failed to employ reasonable measures to detect unauthorized access; and failed to follow proper incident response procedures.  As a result, Wyndham’s security was breached two more times in less than two years.

In March 2009, intruders again gained unauthorized access to Wyndham Hotels and Resorts' network, using similar techniques as in the first breach.  In addition to using memory-scraping malware, they reconfigured software at the Wyndham-branded hotels to obtain clear text files containing the payment card account numbers of guests.  In this second incident, the intruders were able to access information at 39 Wyndham-branded hotels for more than 50,000 consumer payment card accounts and use that information to make fraudulent charges using consumers’ accounts.
Later in 2009, intruders again installed memory-scraping malware and thereby compromised Wyndham Hotels and Resorts’ network and the property management system servers of 28 Wyndham-branded hotels.  As a result of this third incident, the intruders were able to access information for approximately 69,000 consumer payment card accounts and again make fraudulent purchases on those accounts.
The defendants in the case are:  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation; its subsidiary, Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC, which franchises and manages approximately 7,000 hotels; and two subsidiaries of Wyndham Hotel Group – Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, LLC and Wyndham Hotel Management, Inc.

The Commission vote to authorize staff to file the complaint was 5-0, with Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch concurring in the filing of the complaint, but dissenting from including Count II.  The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.

NOTE: The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.  The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have actually violated the law.

Wells Fargo says it was notified on July 1 by MicroBilt, an online consumer and commercial credit bureau information provider, that someone had used a Wells Fargo access code to obtain data on 7,000 consumers from its computers. MicroBilt, located in Kennesaw, GA, says that because of the ongoing law enforcement investigation, they are unable to comment about any details of the case. According to Mary Berg, a Wells Fargo spokesperson, Wells Fargo immediately launched a full-scale investigation into how the information was breached and notified the US Secret Service about the data theft.

MicroBilt provides consumer information to Wells Fargo and other banks and businesses, and interfaces with the three consumer credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. The data breached was for the time period between May and June 2008, says Berg. The two companies (Wells Fargo and MicroBilt) say that business between the two companies has been suspended by mutual agreement.

Berg would not comment on the investigation, but notes Wells Fargo's information security is looking into the loan application area of the bank. ""So far, we do not know how this person or persons gained access to the codes. They may have gotten hold of an employee's access credentials,"" Berg says.

MicroBilt's spokesperson says that law enforcement investigation is looking both internally and externally for how the data was taken. Berg didn't want to comment on what led MicroBilt to become suspicious about the data accessed.

After the breach was discovered, Berg said MicroBilt sent a list of about 7,000 names that had information taken in the data theft. ""We whittled that list down after taking out duplicate names and now have about 5,000 names."" Wells Fargo decided despite the ongoing law enforcement investigation to go ahead and notify all of the affected consumers, even though there are only a few of them that are Wells Fargo customers. Berg wasn't able to give exact numbers because of the investigation. Each victim will receive one year of identity theft protection service, and Berg says Wells Fargo took this step -- even though many aren't Wells Fargo customers -- because it is the company's responsibility to protect them. ""We're doing what we can to alert them so they can protect their accounts,"" Berg says.

In filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, the company said 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen from one of its systems over a period of more than 18 months by an unknown number of intruders. That number eclipses the 40 million records compromised in the mid-2005 breach at CardSystems Solutions and makes the TJX compromise the worst ever involving the loss of personal data.

In addition, personal data provided in connection with the return of merchandise without receipts by about 451,000 individuals in 2003 was also stolen. The company is in the process of contacting individuals affected by the breach, TJX said in its filings.

""Given the scale and geographic scope of our business and computer systems and the time frames involved in the computer intrusion, our investigation has required a substantial period of time to date and is not completed,"" the company said.

Framingham, Mass.-based TJX is the owner of a number of retail brands, including T.J.Maxx, Marshalls and Bob's Stores. In January, the company announced that someone had illegally accessed one of its payment systems and made off with card data belonging to an unspecified number of customers in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and potentially the U.K. and Ireland.

At the time, TJX said it believed the intrusion took place in May 2006 but wasn't discovered until mid-December -- seven months later. A few weeks later, the company revised those dates and said that an investigation by IBM and General Dynamics, two companies it hired in the wake of the breach discovery, believed the intrusion may have taken place in July 2005.

Several banks and credit unions around the country and in the other affected regions had to block and reissue thousands of payment cards as a result of the breach.

In its filing, TJX confirmed that its systems were first accessed illegally in July 2005 and then on several occasions later in 2005, 2006 and even once in mid-January 2007 -- after the breach had already been discovered. However, no data appears to have been stolen after Dec. 18, when the intrusion was first noticed.

The systems that were broken into were based in Framingham and processed and stored information related to payment cards, checks and merchandise returned without receipts. The data breach affected customers of its T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Also affected were customers of its Winners and HomeSense stores in Canada and TK Maxx stores in the U.K.


It is hard to know exactly what kind of data was stolen because a lot of the information accessed by intruders was deleted by the company in the normal course of business. ""In addition, the technology used by the intruder has, to date, made it impossible for us to determine the contents of most of the files we believe were stolen in 2006,"" the company said. It did not elaborate on the technology it was referring to.

Customer names and addresses were not included with any of the payment card data believed stolen from the Framingham systems, TJX said. Also, the company ""generally"" did not store Track 2 data from the magnetic stripe on the back of payment cards for transactions after September 2003, TJX said. Also by April 3, 2006, the company had begun to mask payment card PIN data and ""some other portions of payment card transaction information"" as well as check transaction information, the company said.

""We are continuing to try to identify information stolen in the computer intrusion through our investigation, but other than the information provided ... we believe that we may never be able to identify much of the information believed stolen,"" TJX said.

The company has so far spent about $5 million in connection with the breach, although it is hard to say what other costs may be incurred, the company warned. It cited several lawsuits that have been filed against it since the breach was announced. The company was sued recently by the Arkansas Carpenters Pension Fund, one of its shareholders, for its failure to divulge more details about the breach.

Avivan Litan, an analyst with Stamford,Conn.based Gartner Inc., expressed surprise at the scope of the breach. ""I had heard rumors that it was bigger than CardSystems, but I was still somewhat shocked it was actually this big.""

The number involved in the breach ""makes this the biggest card heist ever,"" she said. ""It proves there are still very sophisticated cybercriminals out there at large who have the potential to wreak havoc on pure-payment systems and who have already stolen millions of dollars from consumers and financial institutions,"" she said.

""If this isn't a wakeup call for stronger card and payment system security, I'm not sure what is,"" she said.

Since mid-January, 2007, a number of putative class actions have been filed against TJX in state and federal courts in Alabama, California, Massachusetts and Puerto Rico, and in provincial Canadian courts in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan, putatively on behalf of customers, including all customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, whose transaction data were allegedly compromised by the Computer Intrusion. An action has also been filed against TJX in federal court in Massachusetts putatively on behalf of all financial institutions who issued credit and debit cards purportedly used at TJX stores during the period of the security breach. The actions assert claims, generally, for negligence and related common-law and/or statutory causes of action stemming from the Computer Intrusion, and seek various forms of relief including damages, related injunctive or equitable remedies, multiple or punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. Various wholly-owned subsidiaries of TJX, as well as Fifth Third Bank and/or Fifth Third Bancorp, are also named as defendants in several of the actions. These cases are all in their initial phases, and no discovery has commenced. On February 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in one of the cases filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL Docket No. 1838, to have all of the actions pending in federal court in the United States and Puerto Rico transferred to the District of Massachusetts for pretrial consolidation and coordination, and TJX has supported that motion. TJX intends to defend these actions vigorously. The actions referenced above are as follows:

In a brief statement released Dec. 2, the Bentonville, Ark.-based company said it was alerted to the problem by credit card issuers who reported that customers were complaining of fraudulent charges on their statements.

It's still not clear how the data was obtained, according to the statement. But ""electronic systems and databases used inside its stores and for Samsclub.com are not involved,"" the company said.

[ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ]
Sam's Club is currently working with both Visa International Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. to investigate the breach. The company also has notified the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Arkansas and the U.S. Secret Service .

Sam's Club officials didn't respond to calls for comment.

In a statement, Visa said it has alerted all of the affected financial institutions, asked them to provide independent fraud-monitoring services to affected customers and requested that they issue new cards as needed.

""Visa will continue working with its member financial institutions, merchants and appropriate authorities to do whatever is necessary to protect cardholders,"" Visa said.

[ Data warehousing and business intelligence are critical to business success. Take this online course and get fluent with the fundamentals. ]
Kayce Bell, chief operating officer at Alabama Credit Union (ACU) in Tuscaloosa, Ala., said the company is reissuing cards to about 500 credit card and debit card holders as a result of the breach. The credit union was alerted to the problem last week by Credit Union National Association Inc., she said.

""We received information through our national reporting service that there had been a very large breach of data at Sam's Club,"" Bell said. About 500 debit cards and credit cards issued by ACU were among the accounts compromised in this incident, she said.

This isn't the first time this year the credit union has had to block and reissue credit and debit cards at Visa's request. Earlier this year, the ACU had to deactivate and reissue about 1,550 cards after Visa notified it that cards compromised in a CardSystems Inc. breach in June were being used fraudulently.

""I find the breach at Sam's Club to be quite surprising,"" said Corinne Sherman, vice president of card services at the Pennsylvania Credit Union Association. What is especially of concern is that Sam's Club appears to have stored information from both tracks of the magnetic stripe on the back of credit cards, thereby raising the potential for data thieves to create counterfeit cards, she said.

Considering the number of similar breaches that have been publicized this year, ""it surprises me that large merchants like Sam's haven't rushed to secure their systems yet,"" Sherman said.

The fallout from such breaches is especially hard on credit unions, a vast majority of whom don't have the size and scale of larger banks, she said. The typical hard costs involved in blocking and replacing cards is around $3.50 per card, she said. But longer-term costs in terms of damage to reputation, customer churn and future fraud losses are much harder to calculate, she said.

""The average consumer doesn't understand that it was Sam's Club who was at fault and not the actual issuer of the card,"" she said.

The Sam's Club breach is the latest in a string of data compromises this year at organizations that have included Bank of America Corp., ChoicePoint Inc. , the University of California and CardSystems. Those breaches have fueled consumer concern about data protection and talk of legislative action to make companies more accountable for the data they own. The breaches have also resulted in Visa and MasterCard requiring all companies that handle payment-card information to comply with their Payment Card Industry (PCI) data-protection standard.

""Visa is aggressively partnering with entities across the nation to broaden adherence to these standards,"" the company said in its statement regarding the Sam's Club breach. ""As Visa has said before, it's important that every entity that handles payment card information adhere to the highest data protection standards, such as the PCI standard, to protect the security and privacy of their customers.""

Even so, such incidents are a test of how far Visa and Mastercard are willing to go to enforce the penalties associated with non-compliance -- particularly when dealing with large merchants, said an analyst at a financial services firm who requested anonymity.

""This opens up some questions on how objectively they will deal with this issue,"" the analyst said. ""Will they pay favorable attention to large retailers like Wal-Mart but be willing in a split second to cut off the mom-and-pop liquor store"" that suffers a similar security breach?", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,48.02999877929688,46.79999923706055,46.13999938964844,45.1500015258789,47.2400016784668,45.93000030517578,48.38999938964844,48.16999816894531,44.09000015258789,45.45000076293945,48.43999862670898,48.849998474121094,45.86999893188477,58.5,58.5

DSW Shoe Warehouse said Monday that it has contact information for about half of those people and started sending letters notifying them of the thefts, which happened at 108 stores in 25 states between November and February. A list of the stores is available on the company's Web site.

The stolen information did not include home addresses or personal identification numbers, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said in a statement.

The company, a subsidiary of Retail Ventures Inc., announced the thefts last month after notifying federal authorities and credit card companies. At the time, the Secret Service said only that information involving more than 100,000 people had been compromised.

Besides the credit card numbers, the thieves obtained driver's license numbers and checking account numbers from 96,000 transactions involving checks, the company said. Customer names, addresses and Social Security numbers were not stolen, DSW said.

""Our loyal customers are our highest priority, and we greatly regret any inconvenience this may cause. We take this issue very seriously and will prosecute those responsible for this crime to the full extent of the law,"" the company said in its statement.

that we hired to perform services on some of our loans, including yours, and to advise you of some
services we are offering to you at no charge to help protect your continued privacy. At this time, we
have no reason to believe that your personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately,
but we are writing this letter to tell you what happened, what information was involved, what we
have done and what you can do to protect your continued privacy.
First, we’d like to explain why we have your personal information. Mortgage lenders often sell
mortgage loans after they have made them. Selling the loans replenishes their funds and enables
them to maintain a continuous flow of mortgage funding for new loans. In your case, your mortgage
loan was sold to us, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Because you
make or have made your mortgage payments to a different company, you probably haven’t had
direct interactions with Freddie Mac. The company that you make your mortgage payments to (which
may be the lender who originally made the loan to you) is responsible for processing your payments
and providing you with customer service. The fact that you are receiving this letter from us does not
mean that there has been any change in your mortgage or your relationship with that other
company.
What Happened?
We recently learned that, earlier this year, a vendor we hired to perform due diligence services on
some of our loans, experienced a ransomware attack on its systems. Because the incident left the
vendor’s system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor does not know all details of the incident or
the information affected.

While we have no indication that your personal information was accessed or used inappropriately,
we have determined that your information, including your loan application data (e.g., name, address,
social security number, date of birth, credit and bank account information), was on the vendor’s
systems at the time of the incident. The vendor has informed us that it has not found any evidence
that your personal information, which was encrypted as required by our contract with them, was
accessed or taken from its systems by the attackers. However, given the nature and circumstances of
the attack, we decided, as a precautionary measure, to make credit monitoring available to you at no

Dozens of data files from Ohio-based LTI Power Systems appeared on a ransomware server in late February, including equipment diagrams and schematics from two Ameren Missouri facilities. No customer information appears to have been involved in the data breach.

St. Louis Public Radio obtained copies of the data files, which span from 1996 to 2017, and involve the Ameren Sioux Power Plant in West Alton and the Labadie Power Plant.
The files include detailed schematics of uninterruptible power supply equipment, used to provide temporary backup power during outages. 
Joe Scherrer, director of the Cybersecurity Strategic Initiative at Washington University, said this type of intellectual property can be a valuable commodity in the cybercriminal marketplace.
“This particular incident is, in my view, all about the theft of intellectual property and making it available for sale to nation-states or other companies,” Scherrer said.
This type of data breach has become increasingly common across a wide range of sectors.
According to the cybersecurity company Emsisoft, ransomware attackers targeted 966 government agencies, schools and health care providers in 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.5 billion.
Many companies have strengthened their cybersecurity in recent years and trained employees to recognize phishing scams — one of the most common ways ransomware attacks gain access to internal systems. 
Still, ensuring the security of third-party vendors remains a challenge, said Scherrer, particularly as attacks become more sophisticated.
“The attack techniques evolve literally on a day-to-day basis,” he said. “They’re approaching this as a business, as a revenue generator, so they’re going to adapt their techniques and procedures to maximize their returns.”
A spokesperson for Ameren Missouri said the company was investigating the data breach but added that it has “no reason to believe that the information obtained is confidential or critical to our operations.”
“In some cases, standard schematics or drawings are shared with equipment suppliers to support the procurement of certain assets,” the spokesperson said in an email. “But these do not contain classified or confidential information.”", ,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.36999893188477,76.77999877929688,69.81999969482422,70.62000274658203,80.20999908447266,80.72000122070312,77.05999755859375,83.02999877929688,79.30000305175781,76.55000305175781,72.87999725341797,71.0,77.97000122070312,82.0,80.8

We are writing to inform you of an incident involving Brighthouse Life Insurance Company
(“Brighthouse”) clients. Please find below relevant information known regarding the incident.
Certain Brighthouse disability insurance policies are partially reinsured by Lincoln Financial.
Lincoln Financial uses a third-party vendor, Disability Insurance Specialists (“DIS”), to administer
the reinsured policies. As a result, certain Brighthouse customer information is stored on DIS
systems.
According to DIS representatives, an unknown user successfully logged into a DIS employee’s
email account for a period of hours on July 9, 2019. DIS discovered the unauthorized access and
launched an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the activity. The investigation
found that the employee had received a phishing email which may have led to the employee’s
credentials being compromised. The investigation did not determine which emails were accessed
or viewed during the period of unauthorized access. The types of information that could have
been accessible or viewable include name, disability insurance number, Social Security Number,
diagnosis information, billing/claims information, or other insurance information relating to the
disability policy or reinsurance policy number. On October 3, 2019, Brighthouse was notified of
the incident. Brighthouse received a complete list of potentially impacted clients on October 18,
2019, and continues to conduct the relevant due diligence to determine applicable notification
requirements.
At this time, we have identified 2 Maryland residents with a Social Security Number and other
insurance information relating to the disability policy in the employee’s records. Additionally, we
have identified 55 Maryland residents with names and disability policy numbers included in the
records, 3 of which also included diagnosis information, and 9 of which included insurance
information relating to the disability policy or reinsurance policy numbers.
A copy of the notification that will be provided to the Maryland residents is attached.
If you have any questions about this data incident, please contact us at

We are writing on behalf of our client, Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. (“Bloomin’ Brands”), to
provide notice of a security incident.
Bloomin’ Brands learned on September 17, 2019 that an unknown person gained the
capability to access information about certain Bloomin’ Brands’ employees by accessing the
network of Corporate Creations, a third-party vendor that served as Bloomin’ Brands’ agent for
receiving service of official documents, such as subpoenas and court orders. Corporate Creations
reported that it was working with a forensic firm to investigate the security incident and had
notified law enforcement. Corporate Creations also reported that it could not determine whether
any specific document regarding a Bloomin’ Brands’ employee was actually accessed during the
incident, but Bloomin’ Brands’ employee information was maintained on the accessed server,
including the names and Social Security numbers of 19 Maryland residents.
Today, Bloomin’ Brands is mailing a notification letter to the Maryland residents in
accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-3504 via United States First-Class mail, in
substantially the same form as the enclosed letter.
Bloomin’ Brands is offering notified individuals a complimentary one-year membership in
credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft protection services from Kroll, and is also
providing notified individuals with a phone number to call with any questions they may have about
the incident. 
Office of the Attorney General
October 17, 2019

Bloomin’ Brands has been in frequent contact with Corporate Creations since it learned
what occurred, and is working to confirm that Corporate Creations will be implementing enhanced
security measures going forward. Bloomin’ Brands has also requested that the vendor securely
and promptly remove information regarding Bloomin’ Brands’ employees from its network when
it is no longer necessary that such information be maintained for purposes of the business
relationship.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Regulation FD Disclosure.

In response to questions it has received, LabCorp® (NYSE: LH) announced that it has been notified by Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc. d/b/a American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA) about unauthorized activity on AMCA’s web payment page (the AMCA Incident). According to AMCA, this activity occurred between August 1, 2018, and March 30, 2019. AMCA is an external collection agency used by LabCorp and other healthcare companies. LabCorp has referred approximately 7.7 million consumers to AMCA whose data was stored in the affected AMCA system. AMCA’s affected system included information provided by LabCorp. That information could include first and last name, date of birth, address, phone, date of service, provider, and balance information. AMCA’s affected system also included credit card or bank account information that was provided by the consumer to AMCA (for those who sought to pay their balance). LabCorp provided no ordered test, laboratory results, or diagnostic information to AMCA. AMCA has advised LabCorp that Social Security Numbers and insurance identification information are not stored or maintained for LabCorp consumers.

AMCA has informed LabCorp that it is in the process of sending notices to approximately 200,000 LabCorp consumers whose credit card or bank account information may have been accessed. AMCA has not yet provided LabCorp a list of the affected LabCorp consumers or more specific information about them.

AMCA has indicated that it is continuing to investigate this incident and has taken steps to increase the security of its systems, processes, and data. LabCorp takes data security very seriously, including the security of data handled by vendors. AMCA has informed LabCorp that it intends to provide the approximately 200,000 affected LabCorp consumers with more specific information about the AMCA Incident, in addition to offering them identity protection and credit monitoring services for 24 months. LabCorp is working closely with AMCA to obtain more information and to take additional steps as may be appropriate once more is known about the AMCA Incident.

In response to initial notification of the AMCA Incident, LabCorp ceased sending new collection requests to AMCA and stopped AMCA from continuing to work on any pending collection requests involving LabCorp consumers.

The activity was subsequently determined to be a new variant of ransomware affecting certain LCD information technology systems. As part of its response, the Company took certain systems offline, which temporarily affected test processing and customer access to test results, and also affected certain other information technology systems involved in conducting Company-wide operations. Operations were returned to normal within a few days of the incident. As part of its in-depth investigation into this incident, the Company engaged outside security experts and worked with authorities, including law enforcement. The investigation determined that the ransomware did not and could not transfer patient or client data outside of Company systems and that there was no theft or misuse of patient or client data. The Company cooperated with law enforcement and regulatory authorities with respect to the incident.
The Company has insurance coverage for costs resulting from cyber-attacks and has filed a claim for recovery of its losses resulting from this incident. However, disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon and the Company has not recognized any estimated proceeds resulting from this claim. Furthermore, while the Company has not been the subject of any legal proceedings involving this incident, it is possible that the Company could be the subject of claims from persons alleging they suffered damages from the incident, or actions by governmental authorities.",11300000,,,2:19-md-02904-MCA-MAH,Bressler Amery & Ross PC,Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP | Carella Byrne Cecchi Olstein Brody & Agnello PC,,163.67999267578125,176.22000122070312,164.77000427246094,167.58999633789062,164.42999267578125,166.0399932861328,170.2899932861328,167.22999572753906,178.5800018310547,181.0399932861328,113.30999755859376,157.64999389648438,179.19000244140625,93.25,104.5

On May 14, 2019, American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA), a billing collections vendor, notified Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (“Quest Diagnostics”) and Optum360 LLC, Quest Diagnostics’ revenue cycle management provider, of potential unauthorized activity on AMCA’s web payment page.  Quest Diagnostics and Optum360 promptly sought information from AMCA about the incident, including what, if any, information was subject to unauthorized access.

Although Quest Diagnostics and Optum360 have not yet received detailed or complete information from AMCA about the incident, AMCA has informed Quest Diagnostics and Optum360 that:


·	
between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system that contained information that AMCA had received from various entities, including Quest Diagnostics, and information that AMCA collected itself;


·	
the information on AMCA’s affected system included financial information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (e.g., Social Security Numbers);


·	
as of May 31, 2019, AMCA believes that the number of Quest Diagnostics patients whose information was contained on AMCA’s affected system was approximately 11.9 million people; and


·	
AMCA has been in contact with law enforcement regarding the incident.

Quest Diagnostics has not been able to verify the accuracy of the information received from AMCA.

Quest Diagnostics’ laboratory test results were not provided to AMCA and were therefore not impacted by this incident.

In response to this incident, Quest Diagnostics has:


·	
suspended sending collection requests to AMCA;


·	
provided notifications to affected health plans and will ensure that notification is provided to regulators and others as required by federal and state law; and


·	
been working and will continue to work diligently, along with Optum360, AMCA and outside security experts, to investigate the AMCA data security incident and its potential impact on Quest Diagnostics and its patients.

Quest Diagnostics has insurance coverage in place for certain potential liabilities and costs relating to the incident; this insurance is limited in amount and subject to a deductible.

Quest Diagnostics takes this matter very seriously and is committed to the privacy and security of patients’ personal, medical and financial information.

Delta said it involved federal law enforcement who confirmed that the incident was resolved last October.

“At this point, even though only a small subset of our customers would have been exposed, we cannot say definitively whether any of our customers’ information was actually accessed or subsequently compromised,” Delta said in a statement.

Company spokesperson Jeff Rogers told Channel 3's Allie Norton the owner of the kiosks the electric company uses for bill pay, TIO Networks USA, was potentially compromised.

The data breach impacts customers who paid with a check at the kiosk. Rogers said it roughly affected 22,000 of their 460,000 customers.

Names, bank routing, account numbers and Gulf Power account numbers could be compromised. Social security numbers and other government numbers were not impacted, Rogers said.

At this time, customers have not filed reports regarding stolen information. Kiosks have been closed at this time.

Customers can pay their Gulf Power bill online or at one of their 200 authorized payment locations in northwest Florida at places like Winn Dixie, Walmart or Publix through Western Union and Check Free Pay.

Rogers said Gulf Power itself did not have a data breach.

""Dear valued customer, unfortunately, the GoToMyPC service has been targeted by a very sophisticated password attack. To protect you, the security team recommend that we reset all customer passwords immediately,"" said Citrix in an incident report.

""Effective immediately, you will be required to reset your GoToMyPC password before you can log-in again. To reset your password please use your regular GoToMyPC log-in link,"" explained Citrix.

Once there you should choose a password carefully, and consider adopting the company's two-factor authentication service.

It's all good advice, and nothing we have not seen before. The short version is to use something long, complex and comprising a mix of numbers and characters. The really short version is don't use 'Passw0rd'.

""When resetting your password we highly recommend using a new password and not the same one the account was set to previously, if possible,"" Citrix added.

""In addition we would like to remind all users that GoToMyPC offers two-step verification, an additional preference which can further enhance the security of your account.""

The letter specifies that the incident took place outside of Google's control when the manager of a third-party company that provides Google with unspecified benefits sent a file with data about Google employees to another manager at another benefits vendor.

Since the recipient of the sensitive data knew the implications of the accidental data exposure, he did not attempt to download or share the document, immediately deleted it from his computer, and then notified Google's vendor of the incident.

""We have no evidence that any of your information has been misused as a result of this incident, and computer access logs indicate that no other individuals viewed your information before it was deleted,"" Google wrote in its notification letter. ""In addition, the benefits manager has confirmed that she did not save, download, disclose or otherwise use the information contained in the document.""

Only names and SSNs were exposed
According to Google, the file in question contained information about the names and Social Security numbers of multiple Google employees. The company specifies that the file did not include any information about employee benefits, nor any information about family members and dependents.

In line with US laws, Google is now providing free identity protection and credit monitoring services for two years for all affected employees.

Two weeks ago, officials of the UK Ministry of Defence had also accidentally sent out an email to the wrong persons. Officials sent a NATO report containing military codes and other military tactics to fishermen and ferry boat operators in the region where military games were taking place. Just as this Google incident, it was all because of the sender of an email did not double-check the recipient's email address.

ADP reported that the company has learned that a small number of its clients have said some of their employees have been victimized by fraudulent registrations through an ADP self-service portal. The only company so far identified as being involved is U.S. Bancorp. Although, according to a report on KrebsonSecurity, up to a dozen others could be involved.

U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman Dana Ripley told SCMagazine.com that the vulnerability has been resolved for her firm and that  issue may have impacted about two percent of its workforce. The company employees about 60,000 people.

ADP said the situation was created when certain companies posted, to an unsecure website, their unique ADP corporate registration code. This information was then used to create employee ADP accounts. To do this the criminal had to locate an unregistered account and then use the personal identifiable information gleaned from the web in conjunction with the corporate ID number to properly register the individual. Once this was done the bad guys could view that person's W-2 information.

""Registration to the portal requires an access code that is unique to each client company. The company registration code is combined with an individual employee's personal information (e.g., partial SSN, DOB, employee number, etc.) to create a unique access code required for portal registration. In this case, these clients made the unique company registration code available to its employees via an unsecured public website. The combination of an unsecured company registration code and stolen personal information (via phishing, malware, etc.) enabled the fraudulent access to the portal, based on ADP's investigation to date,"" said Dick Wolfe, ADP's 
senior director of corporate communications.

Wolfe reiterated that there is no evidence an ADP system housing employee data was compromised.

One industry observer said both sides were to blame for the situation.

“ADP confirmed a weakness in their customer portal — exacerbated by careless security hygiene on the part of their customer companies — that hackers exploited to access the W-2 data of a number of employees at more than a dozen client firms. As ADP works with more than 640,000 companies, this may only be the tip of the iceberg,” Adam Levin, chairman and founder of IDT911, told SCMagazine.com in an email.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,42.97000122070313,43.060001373291016,40.060001373291016,41.43000030517578,44.15999984741211,42.65999984741211,44.0,50.0,51.459999084472656,53.13000106811523,55.47999954223633,51.54999923706055,51.56999969482422,45.0,45.0

Last July, the retailer took down the photo centre website and mobile applications operated by PNI Digital Media, based in Vancouver and owned by Staples Inc. It also notified those who used the photo centre during the period of a possible data breach.

In new emails dated Nov. 4, Walmart said its investigation showed an unauthorized party used “malware” – or malicious software – on some of PNI’s servers supporting its retail clients, including some servers that hosted the Canadian photo centre site.

“The malware is designed to collect credit card and other personal information customers provide when placing an order, including name, email and account password. The malware is not designed to capture images or photos uploaded by customers or to capture a customer’s PIN (personal identification number),” the company said.

“At this point, we are not able to confirm whether any personal customer information potentially collected by the malware was misused by a third party.”

The emails, signed by Walmart Canada Photo Centre Team, told customers to contact their financial institutions if they saw irregular credit card activity and change the passwords used at other sites if they were the same as at the Walmart photo site.

“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your patience,” the email said.

Surprisingly, Walmart did not provide access to a free credit monitoring service to customers whose privacy was breached. This has become standard practice for retailers.

Home Depot Canada, for example, gave customers one year of protection with Equifax Canada after private data was compromised in 2014.

Target Canada, now out of business, also offered a free year of credit monitoring after a data breach in late 2013.

Walmart Canada stopped running its own online photo centres and hired PNI Digital media last year. This led to delayed production of Christmas cards and albums ordered from Nov. 1 to Dec. 14, 2014.

“We realize this is not the service customers have come to expect from Walmart,” spokesman Alex Roberton told me last January.

Walmart gave full refunds to clients whose photo orders were delivered after Christmas – and offered 100 free prints and a $100 photo credit to those with late orders delivered before Dec. 24.

Eric Bouchard placed his photo order last December and sought my help to get delivery in January. He contacted me again last July.

“On top of really bad service from the Walmart photo centre last holiday season, now they have their credit card data stolen,” he said. “This may give them a good lesson that using third parties to save money is not always the best way to go.”

Other retailers that used PNI Digital Media – such as Rite-Aid, CVS and Costco in the U.S., plus Tesco in Britain – also took their photo processing sites offline last July.

Exploiting uploads to an image gallery is a common form of Web attack, said an article at the Techvibes website about the Walmart data breach.

“Attackers will try to upload malicious code instead of an image and attempt to get the code to execute. What we do know is that by hacking one company, attackers were able to grab data from no fewer than five major retailers.”

I could not reach a Walmart Canada spokesperson after several attempts. I found the media link at its website was not working.

A customer said she called the head office in Mississauga (905-821-2111) many times this week to ask for the executive escalation team. She heard only a message to leave a voicemail or many rings with no pickup.

The Walmart data breach may affect 750,000 Canadians, an informed observer told me. It’s potentially bigger than the Medicentres incident in Alberta, when a laptop with the private health information of 620,000 patients was stolen last year.

My view: Walmart is the world’s largest retailer. As Roberton said last July, this is not the service customers expect. The company should do more to show it’s sorry for exposing their private data to hackers.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,58.61000061035156,59.65999984741211,62.91999816894531,67.0,66.77999877929689,68.63999938964844,67.20999908447266,71.05000305175781,73.13999938964844,73.76000213623047,73.0,71.66999816894531,69.16000366210939,61.0,62.45454545454545

However, the company says that, as a precaution, it will proceed to secure the accounts where the EA or Origin user ID matches the usernames on the list.

The company didn’t say how that was being done, but it will likely involve a forced password reset.

The news was first reported by the security-focused website CSO, who had been alerted to the potential breach by one of the victims. The victim claimed that the list of accounts, which has now been pulled from Pastebin, included their EA username, password, email and a full list of their games. But CSO says that wasn’t the case for all the accounts, noting that only some accounts featured the email, password and dates that looked like birthdates, but others seemed to have redacted or corrupted information.

There was initial concern that EA could be yet another business whose account databases had been breached – and it would not be the first time the company would find itself in this situation, had that been the case. Last year, EA admitted to an older data breach that reportedly affected over 40,000 forum members, after a whistleblower came forward.

For now, however, EA is stating that its databases were not infiltrated.

In a statement, a spokesperson notes that:

“Privacy and security is our top priority at EA. At this point, we have no indication that this list was obtained through an intrusion of our account databases. In an abundance of caution, we’re taking steps to secure any account that has an EA or Origin user ID that matches the usernames on this list. As always, we encourage all players to safeguard their account credentials and use unique usernames and passwords on all online accounts.”

Reading between the lines, what this could indicate is that this is instead a scenario where usernames used for other online accounts have now been used in either a phishing or brute force attack to gain entry to EA accounts. With the number of user credentials circulating around the web thanks to prior attacks, it’s fairly trivial for hackers today to take those usernames and emails to create phishing emails or other attacks. In other cases, they simply try the same username and password combos on other services, then share their results.

In fact, the CSO piece points out that a check of some of the accounts listed on the new Pastebin post were those involved with other data breaches, including Adobe, Patreon, the Bitcoin Security Forum Gmail dump, and more. However, other accounts were exposed for the first time via this new list, the post indicates.

But even if EA is saying it has not been hacked, that doesn’t mean that EA account holders have not seen their user accounts accessed by bad actors. It just means that the credentials hackers may have used weren’t directly extracted from EA’s servers.

It’s also unclear at this time whether the list on Pastebin contained new account info, or was recycled following a prior breach or attack. EA couldn’t say, either. However, the company would note that the “number of actual valid/active accounts in the list was very small,” we’re told.

If anything, the news is a reminder of the dangers in using the same username and password combo for services around the web, as one data breach could have a long-lasting impact on the security of your personal information.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,70.56999969482422,69.88999938964844,69.66000366210939,64.48000335693361,59.25,64.79000091552734,64.94000244140625,75.19999694824219,74.5199966430664,78.05000305175781,79.4800033569336,80.83000183105469,82.58999633789062,84.0,84.14200000000002

Dear [INSERT First_Last_Name],
In July 2015, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (“CVS”) learned of reports of unusual activity involving payment cards used on
the CVSPhoto.com website, which is managed and hosted by an independent vendor, PNI Digital Media (“PNI”).
We promptly took down the website, and began working with PNI to investigate the reports. We continue to
actively investigate the matter, working with PNI and experienced forensic investigators.
On August 13, 2015, investigators informed CVS that, between June 2014 and July 2015, there was an illegal
intrusion into PNI’s systems that host the CVSPhoto.com website. This intrusion potentially resulted in the
unauthorized acquisition of data entered by certain users on CVSPhoto.com. Based on the facts known to the
company at this time, the potentially affected personal information may have included your first and last name,
payment card number, expiration date, card verification code, address, phone number, email address, and
username and password for logging in to a CVSPhoto.com account. Importantly, at this time, there is no
indication that the potentially affected information included pin numbers or photographic images.
We want to assure our customers that the CVSPhoto.com website and online payment system are completely
separate from CVS.com and our pharmacies. The incident occurred only within PNI’s network. The incident
did not impact financial transactions on CVS.com or in-store.
What we are doing to protect you
We have arranged for customers who used a payment card on CVSPhoto.com between June 2014 and July 2015
to receive one year of free credit monitoring and resolution of identity theft through Experian’s®

Premera’s Information Technology (IT) systems since as early as May of 2014. Premera discovered the unauthorized
access on January 29, 2015. Premera’s investigation determined that the attackers may have gained unauthorized
access to information on Weyerhaeuser enrollees in Premera health plans, dating back to 2005. Premera says the
information accessed may include name, date of birth, address, email address, telephone number, Social Security
number, member identification number, and claims information, including clinical information.
Premera says it has no evidence at this time that any data was removed at any point during this security breach of
Premera’s IT systems. Premera also says it has no evidence such data has been used inappropriately since the
security breach of Premera’s IT systems. However, because personal information may have been accessed,
Premera also began mailing letters to affected individuals on March 18, 2015. Premera has also indicated that it
has cleansed its IT systems and taken steps to strengthen and enhance its security going forward.", ,,ND,,,,,,,,,,,33.68000030517578,32.150001525878906,32.34000015258789,32.959999084472656,30.959999084472656,31.07999992370605,28.45000076293945,29.420000076293945,30.13999938964844,30.8700008392334,25.81999969482422,23.770000457763672,29.45000076293945,38.0,38.25
